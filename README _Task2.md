# Task 2 â€“ Data Enrichment

This folder contains the script and output for **Task 2: Data Enrichment**, as part of the CIT5900 Project 3.

## Objective

The goal of this task is to enrich the cleaned dataset (`combined_outputs.csv`) with the required metadata fields as specified in the `ResearchOutputs.xlsx` template. This enrichment process includes:

- Adding missing required columns (e.g., `OutputVenue`, `OutputYear`, `ProjectPI`, etc.)
- Filling in missing values with defaults (e.g., "Published", "Completed")
- Formatting `OutputYear` and `OutputMonth` as numerical values
- Cleaning all string-based columns
- Producing a unified output for downstream analysis

## Files Included

| File                          | Description                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `task2_data_enrichment.py`   | Python script that performs data enrichment   |
| `enriched_outputs_sample.csv`| Output file containing the enriched dataset   |
| `combined_outputs.csv`       | Input file merged and deduplicated in Task 1  |

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed with the `pandas` package.

```bash
pip install pandas
python scripts/task2_data_enrichment.py
```

The enriched CSV will be saved to:
```
data/processed/enriched_outputs_sample.csv
```

## Dependencies

- pandas
- os (built-in)

You may optionally create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
pandas
```

## Notes

- This script assumes `combined_outputs.csv` is already cleaned and deduplicated by Task 1.
- Update the file paths as needed if running from a different working directory.
