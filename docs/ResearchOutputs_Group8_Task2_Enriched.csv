using a conceptual framework that counts the number of populations based on the

protect the confidentiality of individual responses through a disclosure
avoidance system that injects noise into census data tabulations. The Bureau
subsequently posed an open question: Could stronger privacy guarantees be
obtained for the 2020 U.S. Census compared to their published guarantees, or
equivalently, had the privacy budgets been fully utilized?
  In this paper, we address this question affirmatively by demonstrating that
the 2020 U.S. Census provides significantly stronger privacy protections than
its nominal guarantees suggest at each of the eight geographical levels, from
the national level down to the block level. This finding is enabled by our
precise tracking of privacy losses using $f$-differential privacy, applied to
the composition of private queries across these geographical levels. Our
analysis reveals that the Census Bureau introduced unnecessarily high levels of
noise to meet the specified privacy guarantees for the 2020 Census.
Consequently, we show that noise variances could be reduced by $15.08\%$ to
$24.82\%$ while maintaining nearly the same level of privacy protection for
each geographical level, thereby improving the accuracy of privatized census

methodology for this prediction task. Unfortunately, BISG suffers from two
Census data problems that contribute to unsatisfactory predictive performance
for minorities. First, the decennial Census often contains zero counts for
minority racial groups in the Census blocks where some members of those groups
reside. Second, because the Census surname files only include frequent names,
many surnames -- especially those of minorities -- are missing from the list.
To address the zero counts problem, we introduce a fully Bayesian Improved
Surname Geocoding (fBISG) methodology that accounts for potential measurement
error in Census counts by extending the naive Bayesian inference of the BISG
methodology to full posterior inference. To address the missing surname

self-reported race is available. Our empirical validation shows that the fBISG

TopDown that ensures a form of Differential Privacy. While the TopDown
algorithm has been made public, no implementation of swapping has been released

secret. Further, the Bureau has not published (even a synthetic) ""original""
dataset and its swapped version. It is therefore difficult to evaluate the
effects of swapping, and to compare these effects to those of other privacy
technologies. To address these difficulties we describe and implement a
parameterized swapping algorithm based on Census publications, court documents,

item, situation, and system are very popular among the researchers. However,
they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such
sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive
and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the
United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into
consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel
pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and
emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people
about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51
states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic
characteristics of the people, built environment data, and the number of
COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to
perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors
that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from
the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education
levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher
house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast,
households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to
reopen the economy. The model can correctly classify 56.18% of the sentiments.
The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high
goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers
where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to
improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of
pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.",group1.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

To what extent do race and/or Hispanic origin responses change? Is change more common to/from some race/ethnic groups than others? Does the propensity to change responses vary by characteristics of the individual? To what extent do these changes affect researchers? We use internal Census Bureau data from the 2000 and 2010 censuses in which individuals’ responses have been linked across years. Approximately 9.8 million people (about 6 percent) in our large, non-representative linked data have a different race and/or Hispanic origin response in 2010 than they did in 2000. Several groups experienced considerable fluidity in racial identification: American Indians and Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, and multiple-race response groups, as well as Hispanics when reporting a race. In contrast, race and ethnic responses for single-race non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asians were relatively consistent over the decade, as were ethnicity responses by Hispanics. People who change their race and/or Hispanic origin response(s) are doing so in a wide variety of ways, as anticipated by previous research. For example, people’s responses change from multiple races to a single race, from a single race to multiple races, from one single race to another, and some people add or drop a Hispanic response. The inflow of people to each race/Hispanic group is in many cases similar in size to the outflow from the same group, such that cross-sectional data would show a small net change. We find response changes across ages, sexes, regions, and response modes, with variation across groups.

Specifically, we impute missing values via sequences of classification and regression trees, which offer a computationally straightforward and flexible approach for semi-automatic, large-scale multiple imputation.

,Comments on: Laying the foundations for a new approach to Census taking in Ireland by John Dunne and Steve MacFeely,Georgetown,Amy B O'Hara,Amy O’Hara,Comments on: Laying the foundations for a new approach to Census taking in Ireland by John Dunne and Steve MacFeely,,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.3233/sji-140849,"The paper by Steve MacFeely and John Dunne sets forth the reasons to establish a National Data Infrastructure in Ireland. Among these are integrating crossnational themes of government efficiency, evidencebased policy, and open data. The use of public sector administrative data for census-taking is a natural use of a National Data Infrastructure, taking advantage of “joined-up data”. MacFeely and Dunne’s paper provides clear examples of the challenges of establishing such data, yet describes a path forward to realize needed efficiencies for Ireland. My comments and reactions relate to the paper as well as John Dunne’s presentation at the International Conference on Census Methods last summer. My colleagues at the U.S. Census Bureau sponsored the event to learn best practices from our international counterparts. We heard of common struggles and great ideas for moving forward, including the Irish initiative discussed in the MacFeely-Dunne paper. But first a bit about the U.S. Statistical System: The U.S. Federal Statistical System is comprised of 13 principal statistical agencies and over 100 statistical programs within Executive Branch agencies. The U.S. does not have a national statistics act. Separate legislative authorities set the domain and scope for each entity within the system. This has important implications for the utility of federal statistical information for Decennial Censuses or policymaking. The U.S. Census Bureau is the largest statistical agency in the U.S. Federal System and the leading source of quality data about the United States people and economy. Like Ireland and other countries, the Census Bureau is exploring uses of administrative records to reduce costs, reduce respondent burden, improve data quality, and produce new data products. The Census Bureau links data for statistical uses, not for enforcement or surveillance use. Statistical use means that information will not be used to make decisions concerning the rights, benefits, or privileges of specific individuals. As discussed at the conference, the U.S. is testing the statistical use of administrative records for the 2020 Census. These efforts build on decades of work describing and encouraging the efficient re-use of government records (e.g. [1,2]). The Census Bureau has heeded advice from the National Research Council [3] and invested in the infrastructure to acquire and link administrative data. The Census Bureau has conducted research to assess coverage and accuracy [5]. We are finding enormous opportunities for address registry and population measurement, analogous to what has happened in may countries in Europe. As the authors explain, integrated (Joined up) data are powerful. In the U.S., government agencies are working together to link data for program evaluation and policy analysis. However, the NDI in Ireland would also be used to achieve administrative efficiency by using person-level data for administrative/official interventions. These non-statistical uses are beyond the scope of work underway at the Census Bureau, Legislative change would be required to have joined-up data for government operations in the U.S. There is an effort to increase the use of administrative records government-wide in the U.S. [4].

In particular, the analyses explore the impact of survey methods on responses to the work limitation (i.e., employment disability) question in these two Census products. Building on the research of Stern (2003) and Stern and Brault (2005), we look for further evidence of misreporting of an employment disability by specific sub-populations using the participation in the Supplemental Security Income program as an exogenous employment disability status indicator along with a subset of ACS disability questions. We expand upon these earlier studies by examining both false-positive and false-negative reports of employment disability by implementing logit estimations to examine the role of respondent/enumerator error on the accuracy of the employment disability response. In this manner, we enhance our understanding of Census 2000 and ACS responses to employment disability questions through an exploration of the role of enumeration procedures in two types of misclassifications, as well as by evaluating existing data and estimates to uncover characteristics that might make an individual more likely to misreport an employment disability.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We explore the impact of the Census Bureau's procedural changes on the racial and ethnic distributions of the Hispanic (generally and by country of origin) and the American Indian and Alaska Native populations, the two populations most impacted by these changes. We use the 2019 and 2021 one-year ACS public-use microdata and 2019 and 2021 NCHS mortality data to compare racial distributions and estimate and compare select demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and mortality measures across the two years. Our results show that changes the Census Bureau implemented beginning with the 2020 decennial census and ACS appear to have had a significant impact on the comparability of Census Bureau race and ethnicity data. We find a significant data discontinuity impacting a wide variety of demographic, socioeconomic, and mortality statistics and analyses that rely on U.S. Census Bureau data as input for calculations. To mitigate these effects, methods that bridge race and ethnicity data between pre- and post-2020 census data are needed.

This trend has fueled population growth in some nonmetropolitan areas and offset population decline in other areas. In this paper, we examine the implications of recent foreign born in‐migration for rural America. Our focus is on a collection of 59 nonmetropolitan counties where growth in foreign born stock offset declines in U.S. native population and resulted in increased local population by 2000. To understand these nonmetropolitan offset counties, we use confidential Census Bureau data that offer us the detailed geography and larger sample size needed to closely examine spatial shifts in the foreign born population, especially those recently arrived. Our findings illustrate dramatic compositional shifts in the populations of these areas, and suggest new demographic complexity in nonmetropolitan areas in the 21 st century.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,
,Does ethnoracial context diversity predict implicit associations of sexual orientation? Evidence from linked Census Bureau and Implicit Association Test data,Missouri,Cody B Spence,Mehrgol Tiv; Cody Spence,Does ethnoracial context diversity predict implicit associations of sexual orientation? Evidence from linked Census Bureau and Implicit Association Test data,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/13684302241290919,"We examined whether exposure to context diversity in one domain relates to mental associations in another social domain. County-level metrics of racial diversity and segregation computed from restricted-use U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey data were linked to a geolocated measure of sexual orientation implicit bias from over 825,000 respondents across the United States (2015–2021). Multilevel models revealed that living in more racially diverse counties was related to less stereotypic implicit associations of sexual orientation, and this relationship was moderated by racial segregation. This primary result was evaluated through a series of robustness checks. Weighted models accounting for the nonrepresentative nature of the sample revealed a robust association with diversity but not an interaction with segregation. The negative relationship with diversity was also replicated on a different Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit attitudes to disability, but the interaction with segregation was again insignificant. These results support the hypothesis that exposure to social diversity in one domain can generalize to intergroup attitudes in another domain. These results also highlight the dynamic interaction between an individual and their social environment, bolstering the need for socially contextualized research on human cognition.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Mule,Comparisons of administrative record rosters to census self-responses and NRFU household member responses1,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3233/sji-230048,"One of the U.S. Census Bureau’s innovations in the 2020 U.S. Census was the use of administrative records (AR) to create household rosters for enumerating some addresses when a response was not available but high-quality ARs were. The goal was to reduce the cost of the fieldwork in the Nonresponse Follow-up (NRFU). The original plan had NRFU beginning in mid-May and continuing through late July. However, the pandemic forced the delay of NRFU and caused the Internal Revenue Service to postpone the income tax filing deadline, resulting in an interruption in the delivery of ARs to the U.S. Census Bureau. The delays were not anticipated when U.S. Census Bureau staff conducted the research on AR enumeration with the 2010 Census data in preparation for the 2020 Census or during the fine tuning of plans for using ARs during the 2018 Census Test. These circumstances raised questions about whether the quality of the AR household rosters was high enough for use in enumeration. To aid in investigating the concern about the quality of the AR rosters, this study compares census rosters to AR rosters that meet a quality standard at addresses that have both and the census roster is either a self-response or a NRFU household member response. A key result is that the mode of census response and the amount of time between the response and the April 1 st reference date impacts the agreement rate between AR roster size and the census roster size at addresses that have both types of rosters.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We document that measurement error in the reporting of higher education is prevalent in Census data. Further, these errors violate models of classical measurement error in important ways. The level of education is consistently reported as higher than it is (errors are not mean 0), errors in the reporting of education are correlated with covariates that appear in earnings regressions, and errors in the reporting of education appear correlated with the error term in a model of earnings determination. Thus, neither well-known results on classical measurement error nor recent models of nonclassical measurement error are likely valid when using Census and CPS data. We find some evidence that the measurement error is lower in the CPS than in the Census, presumably because first interviews are generally conducted in person.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The activities to date have covered both fundamental and applied statistical research and have focused at least in part on the training of current and future generations of researchers in skills of relevance to surveys and alternative measurement of economic units, households, and persons. This article focuses on some of the key research findings of the eight nodes, organized into six topics: (1) improving census and survey data-quality and data collection methods; (2) using alternative sources of data; (3) protecting privacy and confidentiality by improving disclosure avoidance; (4) using spatial and spatio-temporal statistical modeling to improve estimates; (5) assessing data cost and data-quality tradeoffs; and (6) combining information from multiple sources. The article concludes with an evaluation of the ability of the FSS to apply the NCRN’s research outcomes, suggests some next steps, and discusses the implications of this research-network model for future federal government research initiatives.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The Bureau argues the new approach is needed because the confidentiality of census responses is threatened by “database reconstruction,” a technique for inferring individual-level responses from tabular data. The Census Bureau constructed hypothetical individual-level census responses from public 2010 tabular data and matched them to internal census records and to outside sources. The Census Bureau did not compare these results to a null model to demonstrate that their success in matching would not be expected by chance. This is analogous to conducting a clinical trial without a control group. We implement a simple simulation to assess how many matches would be expected by chance. We demonstrate that most matches reported by the Census Bureau experiment would be expected randomly. To extend the metaphor of the clinical trial, the treatment and the placebo produced similar outcomes. The database reconstruction experiment therefore fails to demonstrate a credible threat to confidentiality.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The changes must build on the successes and address the challenges of the previous censuses. Of particular interest is to gauge the on-going quality of the census frames. We address this topic by discussing a set of statistical models for the Master Address File that will produce estimates of coverage error at levels of geography down to the block level. The distributions of added and deleted housing units in a block are used to characterize the undercoverage and overcoverage respectively. The data used are from the 2010 address canvassing operation. As will be shown, these distributions are highly right skewed with a very large proportion of 0 counts. Hence, we utilize zero-inflated regression modelling to determine the predicted distribution of additions and deletions. In addition to standard statistical measures, we gauge the performance of this model by simulating a 2010 address canvassing operation using a specified coverage level. We also discuss future maintenance and updating of this model.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

These findings are from a unique high frequency, real time, survey of small employer businesses, the Census Bureau's Small Business Pulse Survey (SBPS). In contrast, results from the high frequency, real time, Business Formation Statistics (BFS) show there has been a surge in new business applications following an initial decline. Most of these applications are for likely nonemployers; however, there has also been a surge in new applications for likely employers, especially in Retail Trade (and especially Non-store Retailers).

Our purpose was to gather experts from various backgrounds together to continue discussing the development of formal privacy systems for Census Bureau data products. This workshop was a successor to a previous workshop held in October 2016 (Vilhuber & Schmutte 2017). At our prior workshop, we hosted computer scientists, survey statisticians, and economists, all of whom were experts in data privacy. At that time we discussed the practical implementation of cutting-edge methods for publishing data with formal, provable privacy guarantees, with a focus on applications to Census Bureau data products. The teams developing those applications were just starting out when our first workshop took place, and we spent our time brainstorming solutions to the various problems researchers were encountering, or anticipated encountering. For these cutting-edge formal privacy models, there had been very little effort in the academic literature to apply those methods in real-world settings with large, messy data. We therefore brought together an expanded group of specialists from academia and government who could shed light on technical challenges, subject matter challenges and address how data users might react to changes in data availability and publishing standards.In May 2017, we organized a follow-up workshop, which these proceedings report on. We reviewed progress made in four different areas. The four topics discussed as part of the workshop were 1. the 2020 Decennial Census; 2. the American Community Survey (ACS); 3. the 2017 Economic Census; 4. measuring the demand for privacy and for data quality.As in our earlier workshop, our goals were to 1. Discuss the specific challenges that have arisen in ongoing efforts to apply formal privacy models to Census data products by drawing together expertise of academic and governmental researchers; 2.

Scholars have found that estimates generated via Census-released test data are accurate for aggregate total population statistics of larger spatial units (e.g. counties), but introduce considerable discrepancies for estimates of subgroups. At present, the ramifications of this new approach remain unclear for rural populations. In this brief, we focus on rural populations and evaluate the ability of the finalized differential privacy algorithm to provide accurate population counts and growth rates from 2000 to 2010 across the rural-urban continuum for the total, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic or Latino/a, and non-Hispanic American Indian population. We find the method introduces significant discrepancies relative to the prior approach into counts and growth rate estimates at the county level for all groups except the total and non-Hispanic white population. Further, discrepancies increase dramatically as we move from urban to rural. Thus, the differential privacy method likely introduced significant discrepancies for rural and non-white populations into 2020 census tabulations.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

But understanding their social and economic characteristics (e.g., educational attainment, occupations) often requires identifying likely unauthorized immigrants at the individual level. We describe a new method that pools data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which identifies unauthorized immigrants, with data from the American Community Survey (ACS), which does not. This method treats unauthorized status as missing data to be imputed by multiple imputation techniques. Likely unauthorized immigrants in the ACS are identified based on similarities to self-reported unauthorized immigrants in the SIPP.

Census tract data in the United States are a prime example, as there are substantial shifts in tract boundaries from decade to decade. This study compares alternative estimates of the 2000 population living within 2010 tract boundaries to the Census Bureau's own retabulation. All methods of estimation are subject to error; this is the first study to directly quantify the error in alternative interpolation methods for U.S. census tracts. A simple areal weighting method closely approximates the estimates provided by one standard source (the Neighborhood Change Data Base), with some improvement provided by considering only area not covered by water. More information is used by the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB), which relies on a combination of areal and population interpolation as well as ancillary data about water-covered areas. Another set of estimates provided by the National Historical Geographic Information Systems (NHGIS) uses data about land cover in 2001 and the current road network and distribution of population and housing units at the block level. Areal weighting alone results in a large error in a substantial share of tracts that were divided in complex ways. The LTDB and NHGIS perform much better in all situations but are subject to some error when boundaries of both tracts and their component blocks are redrawn. Users of harmonized tract data should be watchful for potential problems in either of these data sources.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

In the United States, scholars face a choice: they can situate fertility in a life course perspective using panel data, which is typically representative only at the national level; or they can attend to subnational contexts using rate schedules, which do not include information on life course statuses. The method and data source we introduce here, Census-Held Linked Administrative Records for Fertility Estimation (CLAR-FE), permits both. It derives fertility histories and rate schedules from U.S. Census Bureau–held data for the nation and by state, racial and ethnic subgroups, and the important life course status of parity. We generate three types of rates for 2000–2020 at the national and state levels by race and ethnicity: age-specific rates and both unconditional and conditional parity- and age-specific rates. Where possible, we compare these rates with those produced by the National Center for Health Statistics. Our new rate schedules illuminate state and racial and ethnic differences in transitions to parenthood, providing evidence of the important subgroup heterogeneity that characterizes the United States. CLAR-FE covers nearly the entire U.S. population and is available to researchers on approved projects through the Census Bureau's Federal Statistical Research Data Centers.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Davis,The Effect of Power Plants on Local Housing Values and Rents: Evidence from Restricted Census Microdata,,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1440906,"Current trends in electricity consumption imply that hundreds of new fossil-fuel power plants will be built in the United States over the next several decades. Power plant siting has become increasingly contentious, in part because power plants are a source of numerous negative local externalities including elevated levels of air pollution, haze, noise and traffic. Policymakers attempt to take these local disamenities into account when siting facilities, but little reliable evidence is available about their quantitative importance. This paper examines neighborhoods in the United States where power plants were opened during the 1990s using household-level data from a restricted version of the U.S. decennial census. Compared to neighborhoods farther away, housing values and rents decreased by 3-5% between 1990 and 2000 in neighborhoods near sites. Estimates of household marginal willingness-to-pay to avoid power plants are reported separately for natural gas and other types of plants, large plants and small plants, base load plants and peaker plants, and upwind and downwind households.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We find that citizenship question response patterns in the American Community Survey (ACS) suggest that it is a sensitive question when asked about administrative record noncitizens but not when asked about administrative record citizens. ACS respondents who were administrative record noncitizens in 2017 frequently choose to skip the question or answer that the person is a citizen. We predict the effect on self-response to the entire survey by comparing mail response rates in the 2010 ACS, which included a citizenship question, with those of the 2010 census, which did not have a citizenship question, among households in both surveys. We compare the actual ACS–census difference in response rates for households that may contain noncitizens (more sensitive to the question) with the difference for households containing only U.S. citizens. We estimate that the addition of a citizenship question will have an 8.0 percentage point larger effect on self-response rates in households that may have noncitizens relative to those with only U.S. citizens. Assuming that the citizenship question does not affect unit self-response in all-citizen households and applying the 8.0 percentage point drop to the 28.1 % of housing units potentially having at least one noncitizen would predict an overall 2.2 percentage point drop in self-response in the 2020 census, increasing costs and reducing the quality of the population count.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Nevertheless, parents of multiracial children were asked for the 1990 US Census to report a single race for their offspring. Using confidential 1990 Census micro-data, we investigate the choices parents made for the three most common racially mixed household types (Asian-white, black-white and Latino-white) in twelve large metropolitan areas. We find that context affects the reporting of children's racial identity. We examine these effects with models that incorporate three spatial scales: households, neighbourhoods and metropolitan areas. Model estimates reveal that racial claims made by parents of Latino- and Asian-white (but not black-white) children varied significantly across metropolitan area. A neighbourhood's proportion white increased the probability that parents reported their children as white, while a neighbourhood's racial diversity increased the probability that black-white parents claimed a non-white race (black or ‘other’) for their children.

This paper reports the results of research and analysis undertaken while the authors were conducting a study approved by the Center for Economic Studies at the US Census Bureau. It has undergone a Census Bureau review more limited in scope than that given to official Census Bureau publications. Research results and conclusions expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily indicate concurrence by the Census Bureau. It has been screened to ensure that no confidential information is revealed. Notes 1. This layering will always be imperfect because, as Goldberg observes, the census form ‘lags behind the complex negotiations of identities and (self-) identifications in everyday experience, even as it serves in part to shape and fix those identities and identifications’ (1997, pp. 32–3). 2. Most US research that measures contextual effects on parents’ racial claims for their children has relied on large geographic units (Public Use Microsample Areas) containing a minimum population of 100,000. Our analysis is the first to use considerably smaller census tracts that contain between 4,000 and 8,000 people, because the Census Bureau provided us with access to confidential information on individuals in households by census tract of residence for the 1990 Census. While considerable debate remains in the social science literature about the most appropriate scale of neighbourhood cartography (e.g. Martin 2003 Martin, D. G. 2003. ‘Enacting neighborhood’. Urban Geography, 24(5): 361–85. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]), and we could have used smaller block groups, census tracts are most suitable for two reasons. One, our broader project engages the existing racial residential segregation literature – a literature that predominantly uses census tracts. Two, despite having access to the full one-in-six sample of long-form respondents, our sample sizes remain small. Census tracts seem to us an appropriate compromise between the detail that a smaller geographic unit might provide and the precedent of previous literature and our data demands. 3. We follow demographic convention in treating all respondents that indicate Latino or Hispanic ancestry as a distinct racial category, regardless of their response to the race question. In so doing we do not assume away the multiple identities subsumed with this meta-category (e.g. those based on national origin, nativity, class and political ideology, among many others). Moreover, we explicitly reject the notion that the terms ‘Latino’ or ‘Hispanic’ mark a meaningful category of ethnic identity. Rather, we see the creation of pan-ethnic Latino/Hispanic identity in the US as a process of racial formation. Also, noting ongoing terminological debates, we use the terms Latino and Hispanic interchangeably. 4. Our larger project includes racial mixing between non-white adults. Because the children from these and other mixed-race pairings were numerically infrequent, we cannot publish such data as we would risk disclosure of information deemed confidential by Census Bureau. 5. Even when women retain the names with which they were born, children still most often carry their father's family name. 6. We assume that parents fill out the census questionnaire in households with young children. 7. We identify mixed-race households as those where the race of the adult male and adult female (where the relationship to the household head is reported as married or partner) differ across the standard race categories used in the 1990 Census (white, black, Asian, Indian, other). We treat all respondents who indicate Latino or Hispanic ancestry as a distinct racial category, regardless of their response to the race question (see note 3 for additional discussion). 8. We configured the sample to mitigate endogeneity between residential location decisions and parents’ views of their children's racial identity. The age restriction improves our assumptions that parents fill out the census form. It also reduces the chance that parents may declare racial identity as children see themselves, which is more likely in older children and reflects non-residential settings. We initially restricted the sample to households that did not move between 1985 and 1990 to eliminate recent residential moves made with children in mind. This restriction, however, removed over two-thirds of the sample. We kept recent movers in the sample and controlled for their residential mobility with a variable in the models. 9. The standard entropy diversity measure for each tract is , where k indexes racial groups, j indexes census tracts and t indexes total tract population. The maximum value of Ej is obtained when tract j's population is evenly divided between the k racial groups. Since the number of racial groups limits the magnitude of the maximum value, we include a scaling constant s so that Ej ranges between 0 and 1. We calculated Ej based on individuals in the six standard racial groups (Latino, white, black, Asian, Native American and other).",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The author analyzes the latest version of the projections and finds that the pivotal group is made up of individuals who come from mixed minority-white family backgrounds. It is projected to grow very rapidly in coming decades, and Census Bureau classification practices mean that most of its members are counted as minority. Without this classification, however, the emergence of a majority-minority society by 2060 is far from certain. Moreover, the evidence we possess about the characteristics, social affiliations, and identities of mixed individuals contradicts this Census Bureau practice, except for partly black individuals, who suffer from high levels of racism. Taking into account the ambiguous social locations of most mixed minority-white persons, the author suggests that, even should a majority-minority society appear, it will not look like we presently imagine it.",group2.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. Results Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research. Conclusions The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

This study assessed the validity of a census-based approach in addressing these problems.Socioeconomic data from 1980 census tracts and block groups were matched to the 1985 membership records of a large prepaid health plan (n = 1.9 million), with the link provided by each individual's residential address. Among a subset of 14,420 Black and White members, comparisons were made of the association of individual, census tract, and census block-group socioeconomic measures with hypertension, height, smoking, and reproductive history.Census-level and individual-level socioeconomic measures were similarly associated with the selected health outcomes. Census data permitted assessing response bias due to missing individual-level socioeconomic data and also contextual effects involving the interaction of individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic traits. On the basis of block-group characteristics, health plan members generally were representative of the total population; persons in impoverished neighborhoods, however, were underrepresented.This census-based methodology offers a valid and useful approach to overcoming the absence of socioeconomic data in most US medical records.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The PES was a stratified block sample with heavy emphasis placed on hard-to-count population groups. Matching the individuals in the census to the individuals in the PES is an important aspect of census coverage evaluation and consequently a very important process for any census adjustment operations that might be planned. For such an adjustment to be feasible, record-linkage software had to be developed that could perform matches with a high degree of accuracy and that was based on an underlying mathematical theory. A principal purpose of the PES was to provide an opportunity to evaluate the newly implemented record-linkage system and associated methodology. This article discusses the theoretical and practical issues encountered in conducting the matching operation and presents the results of that operation. A review of the theoretical background of the record-linkage problem provides a framework for discussions of the decision procedure, file blocking, and the independence assumption. The estimation of the parameters required by the decision procedure is an important aspect of the methodology, and the techniques presented provide a practical system that is easily implemented. The matching algorithm (discussed in detail) uses the linear sum assignment model to ""pair"" the records. The Tampa, Florida, matching methodology is described in the final sections of the article. Included in the discussion are the results of the matching itself, an independent clerical review of the matches and nonmatches, conclusions, problem areas, and future work required.

Moving groups are identified by combining de Bruijne's refurbished convergent point method with the `Spaghetti method' of Hoogerwerf &amp; Aguilar. Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the expected number of interloper field stars. Astrometric members are listed for 12 young stellar groups, out to a distance of ~650 pc. These are the 3 subgroups Upper Scorpius, Upper Centaurus Lupus and Lower Centaurus Crux of Sco OB2, as well as Vel OB2, Tr 10, Col 121, Per OB2, alpha Persei (Per OB3), Cas-Tau, Lac OB1, Cep OB2, and a new group designated as Cep OB6. The selection procedure corrects the list of previously known astrometric and photometric B- and A-type members, and identifies many new members, including a significant number of F stars, as well as evolved stars, e.g., the Wolf-Rayet stars gamma^2 Vel (Vel OB2) and EZ CMa (Col 121), and the classical Cepheid delta Cep in Cep OB6. In the nearest associations the later-type members include T Tauri objects and other pre-main sequence stars. Astrometric evidence for moving groups in the fields of R CrA, CMa OB1, Mon OB1, Ori OB1, Cam OB1, Cep OB3, Cep OB4, Cyg OB4, Cyg OB7, and Sct OB2, is inconclusive, due to their large distance or unfavorable kinematics. The mean distances of the well-established groups are systematically smaller than previous estimates. The mean motions display a systematic pattern, which is discussed in relation to the Gould Belt. Six of the 12 detected moving groups do not appear in the classical list of nearby OB associations. The number of unbound young stellar groups in the Solar neighbourhood may be significantly larger than thought previously.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Since these actin-based motors are candidates to provide the molecular basis for many cellular movements, it is essential that motility researchers be aware of the complete set of myosins in a given organism. The availability of cDNA and/or draft genomic sequences from humans,Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, andDictyostelium discoideum has allowed us to tentatively define and compare the sets of myosin genes in these organisms. This analysis has also led to the identification of several putative myosin genes that may be of general interest. In humans, for example, we find a total of 40 known or predicted myosin genes including two new myosins-I, three new class II (conventional) myosins, a second member of the class III/ninaC myosins, a gene similar to the class XV deafness myosin, and a novel myosin sharing at most 33% identity with other members of the superfamily. These myosins are in addition to the recently discovered class XVI myosin with N-terminal ankyrin repeats and two human genes with similarity to the class XVIII PDZ-myosin from mouse. We briefly describe these newly recognized myosins and extend our previous phylogenetic analysis of the myosin superfamily to include a comparison of the complete or nearly complete inventories of myosin genes from several experimentally important organisms.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Mutation of the TP53 gene alters its response pathway, and is central to the development of many cancers. The discovery of a large number of p53 target genes, which confer p53's tumor suppressor function, has led to increasingly complex models of p53 function. Recent meta-analysis approaches, however, are simplifying our understanding of how p53 functions as a transcription factor. In the survey presented here, a total set of 3661 direct p53 target genes is identified that comprise 3509 potential targets from 13 high-throughput studies, and 346 target genes from individual gene analyses. Comparison of the p53 target genes reported in individual studies with those identified in 13 high-throughput studies reveals limited consistency. Here, p53 target genes have been evaluated based on the meta-analysis data, and the results show that high-confidence p53 target genes are involved in multiple cellular responses, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis, metabolism, autophagy, mRNA translation and feedback mechanisms. However, many p53 target genes are identified only in a small number of studies and have a higher likelihood of being false positives. While numerous mechanisms have been proposed for mediating gene regulation in response to p53, recent advances in our understanding of p53 function show that p53 itself is solely an activator of transcription, and gene downregulation by p53 is indirect and requires p21. Taking into account the function of p53 as an activator of transcription, recent results point to an unsophisticated means of regulation.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Most of the 622 putative protein complexes we report are linked to core biological processes and encompass both candidate disease genes and unannotated proteins to inform on mechanism.

Many of these are regulated by proteins related to the LuxR and LuxI proteins of Vibrio fischeri, and by a diffusible pheromone called an autoinducer. LuxR and LuxI and their cognate autoinducer (3-oxohexanoyl homoserine lactone, designated VAI-1) provide an important model to describe the functions of this family of proteins. LuxR is a VAI-1 receptor and a VAI-1–dependent transcriptional activator, and LuxI directs the synthesis of VAI-1. VAI-1 diffuses across the bacterial envelope, and intracellular concentrations of it are therefore strongly increased by nearby VAI-1–producing bacteria. Similar systems regulate pathogenesis factors in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Erwinia spp., as well as Ti plasmid conjugal transfer in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and many other genes in numerous genera of gram-negative bacteria. Genetic analyses of these systems have revealed a high degree of functional conservation, while also uncovering features that are unique to each.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

While there is a general appreciation that these sequences are largely unique and derived from diverse species of bacteria, there has not been a quantitative attempt to describe the extent of sequencing efforts to date. We constructed rarefaction curves for each bacterial phylum and for the entire bacterial domain to assess the current state of sampling and the relative taxonomic richness of each phylum. This analysis quantifies the general sense among microbiologists that we are a long way from a complete census of the bacteria on Earth. Moreover, the analysis indicates that current sampling strategies might not be the most effective ones to describe novel diversity because there remain numerous phyla that are globally distributed yet poorly sampled. Based on the current level of sampling, it is not possible to estimate the total number of bacterial species on Earth, but the minimum species richness is 35,498. Considering previous global species richness estimates of 10 7 to 10 9 , we are certain that this estimate will increase with additional sequencing efforts. The data support previous calls for extensive surveys of multiple chemically disparate environments and of specific phylogenetic groups to advance the census most rapidly.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We outline the combination of widely available, remotely-sensed and geospatial data that contribute to the modeled dasymetric weights and then use the Random Forest model to generate a gridded prediction of population density at ~100 m spatial resolution. This prediction layer is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level. As a case study we compare the new algorithm and its products for three countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Kenya) with other common gridded population data production methodologies.

Here, we explore prokaryotic diversity from the perspective of the GTDB and highlight the importance of metagenome-assembled genomes in expanding available genomic representation. We also discuss improvements to the GTDB website which allow tracking of taxonomic changes, easy assessment of genome assembly quality, and identification of genomes assembled from type material or used as species representatives. Methodological updates and policy changes made since the inception of the GTDB are then described along with the procedure used to update species clusters in the GTDB.

High-quality sequences of chicken and turkey gastrointestinal origin (3,184 and 1,345, respectively) were collected from the GenBank, Ribosomal Database Project, and Silva comprehensive ribosomal RNA database. Through phylogenetic and statistical analysis, 915 and 464 species-equivalent operational taxonomic units (defined at 0.03 phylogenetic distance) were found in the chicken and the turkey sequence collections, respectively. Of the 13 bacterial phyla identified in both bird species, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were the largest phyla, accounting for >90% of all the sequences. The chicken sequences represent 117 established bacterial genera, and the turkey sequences represent 69 genera. The most predominant genera found in both the chicken and the turkey sequence data sets were Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides, but with different distribution between the 2 bird species. The estimated coverage of bacterial diversity of chicken and turkey reached 89 and 68% at species-equivalent and 93 and 73% at genus-equivalent levels, respectively. Less than 7,000 bacterial sequences from each bird species from various locations would be needed to reach 99% coverage for either bird species. Based on annotation of the sequence records, cecum was the most sampled gut segment. Chickens and turkeys were shown to have distinct intestinal microbiomes, sharing only 16% similarity at the species-equivalent level.

The 75,000 dams in the continental United States are capable of storing a volume of water almost equaling one year's mean runoff, but there is considerable geographic variation in potential surface water impacts. In some western mountain and plains regions, dams can store more than 3 year's runoff, while in the Northeast and Northwest, storage is as little as 25% of the annual runoff. Dams partition watersheds; the drainage area per dam varies from 44 km 2 (17 miles 2 ) per dam in New England to 811 km 2 (313 miles 2 ) per dam in the Lower Colorado basin. Storage volumes, indicators of general hydrologic effects of dams, range from 26,200 m 3 km −2 (55 acre‐feet mile −2 ) in the Great Basin to 345,000 m 3 km −2 (725 acre‐feet mile −2 ) in the South Atlantic region. The greatest river flow impacts occur in the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and the arid Southwest, where storage is up to 3.8 times the mean annual runoff. The nation's dams store 5000 m 3 (4 acre‐feet) of water per person. Water resource regions have experienced individualized histories of cumulative increases in reservoir storage (and thus of downstream hydrologic and ecologic impacts), but the most rapid increases in storage occurred between the late 1950s and the late 1970s.

We developed a statistical model that makes the problem of estimating richness statistically accessible by evaluating the characteristics of samples drawn from simulated communities with parametric community distributions. We identified simulated communities with rank-abundance distributions that followed a truncated lognormal distribution whose samples resembled the structure of 16S rRNA gene sequence collections made using Alaskan and Minnesotan soils. The simulated communities constructed based on the distribution of 16S rRNA gene sequences sampled from the Alaskan and Minnesotan soils had a richness of 5,000 and 2,000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively, where an OTU represents a collection of sequences not more than 3% distant from each other. To sample each of these OTUs in the Alaskan 16S rRNA gene library at least twice, 480,000 sequences would be required; however, to estimate the richness of the simulated communities using nonparametric richness estimators would require only 18,000 sequences. Quantifying the richness of complex environments such as soil is an important step in building an ecological framework.

It would be desirable to have an image-to-image transform, which uncovers only the structure of an object for an efficient matching. In this context the contribution of our work is two-fold. First, we introduce illumination invariant local structure features for object detection. For an efficient computation we propose a modified census transform which enhances the original work of Zabih and Woodfill. We show some shortcomings and how to get over them with the modified version. S6econdly, we introduce an efficient four-stage classifier for rapid detection. Each single stage classifier is a linear classifier, which consists of a set of feature lookup-tables. We show that the first stage, which evaluates only 20 features filters out more than 99% of all background positions. Thus, the classifier structure is much simpler than previous described multi-stage approaches, while having similar capabilities. The combination of illumination invariant features together with a simple classifier leads to a real-time system on standard computers (60 msec, image size: 288/spl times/384, 2GHi Pentium). Detection results are presented on two commonly used databases in this field namely the MIT+CMU set of 130 images and the BioID set of 1526 images.

The preferred statistical model for plant‐level growth includes plant fixed effects, industry by period fixed effects, and county by period fixed effects. The estimates from this model suggest that in the first 15 years in which the Clean Air Act was in force (1972–87), nonattainment counties (relative to attainment ones) lost approximately 590,000 jobs, $37 billion in capital stock, and $75 billion (1987 dollars) of output in pollution‐intensive industries.

,UnFlow: Unsupervised Learning of Optical Flow With a Bidirectional Census Loss,,Simon Meister,Simon Meister; Junhwa Hur; Stefan Roth,UnFlow: Unsupervised Learning of Optical Flow With a Bidirectional Census Loss,unflow; learning; optical; flow; bidirectional; census; loss,2018.0,10.1609/aaai.v32i1.12276,"In the era of end-to-end deep learning, many advances in computer vision are driven by large amounts of labeled data. In the optical flow setting, however, obtaining dense per-pixel ground truth for real scenes is difficult and thus such data is rare. Therefore, recent end-to-end convolutional networks for optical flow rely on synthetic datasets for supervision, but the domain mismatch between training and test scenarios continues to be a challenge. Inspired by classical energy-based optical flow methods, we design an unsupervised loss based on occlusion-aware bidirectional flow estimation and the robust census transform to circumvent the need for ground truth flow. On the KITTI benchmarks, our unsupervised approach outperforms previous unsupervised deep networks by a large margin, and is even more accurate than similar supervised methods trained on synthetic datasets alone. By optionally fine-tuning on the KITTI training data, our method achieves competitive optical flow accuracy on the KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks, thus in addition enabling generic pre-training of supervised networks for datasets with limited amounts of ground truth.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The Bureau argues the new approach is needed because the confidentiality of census responses is threatened by “database reconstruction,” a technique for inferring individual-level responses from tabular data. The Census Bureau constructed hypothetical individual-level census responses from public 2010 tabular data and matched them to internal census records and to outside sources. The Census Bureau did not compare these results to a null model to demonstrate that their success in matching would not be expected by chance. This is analogous to conducting a clinical trial without a control group. We implement a simple simulation to assess how many matches would be expected by chance. We demonstrate that most matches reported by the Census Bureau experiment would be expected randomly. To extend the metaphor of the clinical trial, the treatment and the placebo produced similar outcomes. The database reconstruction experiment therefore fails to demonstrate a credible threat to confidentiality.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Little empirical attention has been given to the validity of this approach. The authors estimate health outcome equations using samples from nationally representative data sets linked to census data. They investigate whether statistical power is sensitive to the timing of census data collection or to the level of aggregation of the census data; whether different census items are conceptually distinct; and whether the use of multiple aggregate measures in health outcome equations improves prediction compared with a single aggregate measure. The authors find little difference in estimates when using 1970 compared with 1980 US Bureau of the Census data or zip code compared with tract level variables. However, aggregate variables are highly multicollinear. Associations of health outcomes with aggregate measures are substantially weaker than with microlevel measures. The authors conclude that aggregate measures can not be interpreted as if they were microlevel variables nor should a specific aggregate measure be interpreted to represent the effects of what it is labeled.

These approaches can provide detailed information about urban behaviors, but they're hard to update and might limit results to ""snapshots in time."" In the past few years, some innovative approaches have sought to use mobile devices to collect spatiotemporal data. But little research has been done to develop and analyze the much larger samples of existing data generated daily by mobile networks. The most common explanation for this is that the challenge of data-sharing with the telecommunications industry has hampered data access. However, in early 2006, a collaboration between Telecom Italia, which serves 40 percent of the Roman market, and MIT's SKNSEable City Laboratory (http://senseable.mit.edu) allowed unprecedented access to aggregate mobile phone data from Rome.

Sutherland,Census error and the detection of density dependence,census; error; detection; density; dependence,2006.0,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01121.x,"Summary Studies aiming to identify the prevalence and nature of density dependence in ecological populations have often used statistical analysis of ecological time‐series of population counts. Such time‐series are also being used increasingly to parameterize models that may be used in population management. If time‐series contain measurement errors, tests that rely on detecting a negative relationship between log population change and population size are biased and prone to spuriously detecting density dependence (Type I error). This is because the measurement error in density for a given year appears in the corresponding change in population density, with equal magnitude but opposite sign. This effect introduces bias that may invalidate comparisons of ecological data with density‐independent time‐series. Unless census error can be accounted for, time‐series may appear to show strongly density‐dependent dynamics, even though the density‐dependent signal may in reality be weak or absent. We distinguish two forms of census error, both of which have serious consequences for detecting density dependence. First, estimates of population density are based rarely on exact counts, but on samples. Hence there exists sampling error, with the level of error depending on the method employed and the number of replicates on which the population estimate is based. Secondly, the group of organisms measured is often not a truly self‐contained population, but part of a wider ecological population, defined in terms of location or behaviour. Consequently, the subpopulation studied may effectively be a sample of the population and spurious density dependence may be detected in the dynamics of a single subpopulation. In this case, density dependence is detected erroneously, even if numbers within the subpopulation are censused without sampling error. In order to illustrate how process variation and measurement error may be distinguished we review data sets (counts of numbers of birds by single observers) for which both census error and long‐term variance in population density can be estimated. Tests for density dependence need to obviate the problem that measured population sizes are typically estimates rather than exact counts. It is possible that in some cases it may be possible to test for density dependence in the presence of unknown levels of census error, for example by uncovering nonlinearities in the density response. However, it seems likely that these may lack power compared with analyses that are able to explicitly include census error and we review some recently developed methods.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Sampling this environmental DNA (eDNA) is a potentially powerful means of assessing whole biological communities, a significant advance over the manual methods of environmental sampling that have historically dominated marine ecology and related fields. Here, we estimate the vertebrate fauna in a 4.5-million-liter mesocosm aquarium tank at the Monterey Bay Aquarium of known species composition by sequencing the eDNA from its constituent seawater. We find that it is generally possible to detect mitochondrial DNA of bony fishes sufficient to identify organisms to taxonomic family- or genus-level using a 106 bp fragment of the 12S ribosomal gene. Within bony fishes, we observe a low false-negative detection rate, although we did not detect the cartilaginous fishes or sea turtles present with this fragment. We find that the rank abundance of recovered eDNA sequences correlates with the abundance of corresponding species' biomass in the mesocosm, but the data in hand do not allow us to develop a quantitative relationship between biomass and eDNA abundance. Finally, we find a low false-positive rate for detection of exogenous eDNA, and we were able to diagnose non-native species' tissue in the food used to maintain the mesocosm, underscoring the sensitivity of eDNA as a technique for community-level ecological surveys. We conclude that eDNA has substantial potential to become a core tool for environmental monitoring, but that a variety of challenges remain before reliable quantitative assessments of ecological communities in the field become possible.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Zabludoff,A Census of Baryons in Galaxy Clusters and Groups,census; baryons; galaxy; clusters; groups,2007.0,10.1086/519729,"We determine the contribution of stars in galaxies, intracluster stars, and the intracluster medium to the total baryon budget in nearby galaxy clusters and groups. We find that the baryon mass fraction (f_b) within r500 is constant for systems with M500 between 6e13 and 1e15 Msun. Although f_b is lower than the WMAP value, the shortfall is on the order of both the observational systematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that is predicted by simulations. The data therefore provide no compelling evidence for undetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance with cluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion of the contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increase in X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted for by a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument that the behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by a decrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within just the stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCG and ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICL component, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficiently in higher mass environments. The degree to which this behavior arises from our sample selection, which favored systems with central, giant elliptical galaxies, remains unclear. A more robust result is the identification of low mass groups with large BCG+ICL components, demonstrating that the creation of intracluster stars does not require a massive cluster environment. Within r500 and r200, the BCG+ICL contributes on average 40% and 33% of the total stellar light, respectively.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Lacy,"Changing Race: Latinos, the Census, and the History of Ethnicity in the United States",race; latinos; census; history; ethnicity; united; states,2001.0,10.1215/00182168-81-3-4-774,"Figures just released from the 2000 U.S. Census reveal what demographers have predicted for the past decade: Latinos are surpassing African Americans as the country’s largest minority group. Yet because of differences in national origin, physical appearance, historical memory, class, and religion, no single group identity exists for this rapidly growing population. In part because of this diversity, in the 2000 Census, respondents, for the first time, could select more than one racial category. Clara Rodríguez’s newest work on Latinos in the U.S. examines difficulties in categorizing this group as part of a broader discussion of ethnicity and race in the United States. She chose as her lens the U.S. Census Bureau because census categories and definitions reveal a society’s “dominant ideals and beliefs” (p. xiv) and such definitions shape how peoples and individuals see themselves and others. Rodríguez’s aim is to demonstrate through the Latino experience that race is not fixed; it is “imperfectly measured” and can lead to discrimination and misunderstanding. A sociologist by training, Rodríguez draws upon her own experiences as a Latina, on interviews, analyses of census data, and secondary works from a variety of disciplines.The difficulty in classifying Latinos underscores one of Rodríguez’s main points: definitions of race and ethnicity are subjective and dependent on context. Some public agencies consider Latinos a race, but the Bureau of the Census does not (a topic to which the author devotes ample space). Rodríguez argues that most in the U.S. conflate race and ethnicity, and see race as genetically determined and fixed (as evidenced by Census Bureau efforts to make Latinos and other groups fit the bipolar racial categories of white and non-white). Meanwhile, for Latinos, race and ethnicity are culturally determined, fluid, and contextual. As Rodríguez explains, these divergent notions of race and ethnicity came out of our respective historical experiences.Rodríguez describes the evolution of the U.S.’s bipolar racial paradigm by tracing the Census Bureau’s two-hundred-year history of shifting categories and criteria. She ably links changing racial definitions over time to broader social and political factors, and sees the Bureau’s recent efforts to more accurately categorize Hispanics as evidence that notions of race and ethnicity are undergoing further adjustment in this country.This broad treatment of Latino identity and U.S. efforts to categorize its diverse populations will complement the plethora of new works on the Latino experience in the U.S. It should prove useful also to historians of race and ethnicity in America. While Rodríguez’s arguments are somewhat disorganized and repetitive, the redundancy permits the use of individual chapters for teaching purposes. Further, although little new scholarship appears here, the author provides a relatively thorough review of the literature on issues such as Latino identity formation and acculturation. In addition, Rodríguez’s history of Census activities is also quite thorough, and the book is richly documented. Those seeking more on the historical development of notions of race and ethnicity in Latin America will no doubt be disappointed, however, given the outdated and limited resources consulted. Perhaps the real value of this work is the perspective it offers on how Latinos in this country have been perceived and how they perceive themselves. It is likely that this population group will prove quite instrumental in reshaping our ideas of race and ethnicity.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

As of November 2010, 13,478 bacterial and 3516 archaeal rrn sequences were found. The bacterial sequences were assigned to 5271 operation taxonomic units (OTUs) at species level (0.03 phylogenetic distance) representing 19 existing phyla, of which the Firmicutes (2958 OTUs), Bacteroidetes (1610 OTUs) and Proteobacteria (226 OTUs) were the most predominant. These bacterial sequences were grouped into more than 3500 OTUs at genus level (0.05 distance), but only 180 existing genera were represented. Nearly all the archaeal sequences were assigned to 943 species-level OTUs in phylum Euryarchaeota. Although clustered into 670 genus-level OTUs, only 12 existing archaeal genera were represented. Based on rarefaction analysis, the current percent coverage at species level reached 71% for bacteria and 65% for archaea. At least 78,218 bacterial and 24,480 archaeal sequences would be needed to reach 99.9% coverage.

However, time‐inconsistency problems related to top coding lead many CPS users to measure inequality via the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile (P90/P10) rather than by more traditional summary measures. With access to public use and restricted‐access internal CPS data, and by applying bounding methods, we show that using P90/P10 does not completely obviate time‐inconsistency problems, especially in capturing household income inequality trends. Using internal data, we create consistent cell mean values for all top‐coded public use values that, when used with public use data, closely track inequality trends in earnings and household income using internal data. But estimates of longer‐term inequality trends with these corrected data based on P90/P10 differ from those based on the Gini coefficient. The choice of inequality measure still matters.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

In studies of wild animals, one frequently encounters both census and mark-recapture-recovery data. We show how a state-space model for census data in combination with the usual multinomial-based models for ring-recovery data provide estimates of productivity not available from either type of data alone. The approach is illustrated on two British bird species. For the lapwing, we calibrate how its recent decline could be due to a decrease in productivity. For the heron, there is no evidence for a decline in productivity, and the combined analysis increases significantly the strength of logistic regressions of survival on winter severity.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We update the baryon census in the (H i) Lyα forest and warm-hot IGM (WHIM) at 105–6 K traced by O vi λ1032, 1038 absorption. From Enzo cosmological simulations of heating, cooling, and metal transport, we improve the H i and O vi baryon surveys using spatially averaged corrections for metallicity (Z/Z☉) and ionization fractions (fH i, fO vi). Statistically, the O vi correction product correlates with column density, (Z/Z☉)fO vi ≈ (0.015)(NO vi/1014 cm−2)0.70, with an NO vi-weighted mean of 0.01, which doubles previous estimates of WHIM baryon content. We also update the Lyα forest contribution to baryon density out to z = 0.4, correcting for the (1 + z)3 increase in absorber density, the (1 + z)4.4 rise in photoionizing background, and cosmological proper length dℓ/dz. We find substantial baryon fractions in the photoionized Lyα forest (28% ± 11%) and WHIM traced by O vi and broad-Lyα absorbers (25% ± 8%). The collapsed phase (galaxies, groups, clusters, CGM) contains 18% ± 4%, leaving an apparent baryon shortfall of 29% ± 13%. Our simulations suggest that ∼15% reside in hotter WHIM (T ⩾ 106 K).

Results This paper presents results of a comprehensive census of signal transduction proteins – histidine kinases, methyl-accepting chemotaxis receptors, Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases, adenylate and diguanylate cyclases and c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases – encoded in 167 bacterial and archaeal genomes, sequenced by the end of 2004. The data have been manually checked to avoid false-negative and false-positive hits that commonly arise during large-scale automated analyses and compared against other available resources. The census data show uneven distribution of most signaling proteins among bacterial and archaeal phyla. The total number of signal transduction proteins grows approximately as a square of genome size. While histidine kinases are found in representatives of all phyla and are distributed according to the power law, other signal transducers are abundant in certain phylogenetic groups but virtually absent in others. Conclusion The complexity of signaling systems differs even among closely related organisms. Still, it usually can be correlated with the phylogenetic position of the organism, its lifestyle, and typical environmental challenges it encounters. The number of encoded signal transducers (or their fraction in the total protein set) can be used as a measure of the organism's ability to adapt to diverse conditions, the 'bacterial IQ', while the ratio of transmembrane receptors to intracellular sensors can be used to define whether the organism is an 'extrovert', actively sensing the environmental parameters, or an 'introvert', more concerned about its internal homeostasis. Some of the microorganisms with the highest IQ, including the current leader Wolinella succinogenes , are found among the poorly studied beta-, delta- and epsilon-proteobacteria. Among all bacterial phyla, only cyanobacteria appear to be true introverts, probably due to their capacity to conduct oxygenic photosynthesis, using a complex system of intracellular membranes. The census data, available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Complete_Genomes/SignalCensus.html , can be used to get an insight into metabolic and behavioral propensities of each given organism and improve prediction of the organism's properties based solely on its genome sequence.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Even after discounting systematic underreporting of operations and environmental outages, the conclusion is clear: hardware faults and hardware maintenance are no longer a major source of outages. As the other components of the system become increasingly reliable, software necessarily becomes the dominant cause of outages.

Based on a comprehensive analysis of empirical literature from the past two decades, we asked: (i) how often do studies link N e to the adult census population size ( N )? (ii) To what extent is N e correctly linked to N ? (iii) How readily is uncertainty accounted for in both N e and N when quantifying N e / N ratios? and (iv) how frequently and to what degree might errors in the estimation of N e or N affect inferences of N e / N ratios? We found that only 20% of available N e estimates (508 of 2617; 233 studies) explicitly attempted to link N e and N ; of these, only 31% (160 of 508) correctly linked N e and N . Moreover, only 7% (41 of 508) of N e / N ratios (correctly linked or not) reported confidence intervals for both N e and N ; for those cases where confidence intervals were reported for N e only, 31% of N e / N ratios overlapped with 1, of which more than half also reached below N e / N = 0.01. Uncertainty in N e /N ratios thus sometimes spanned at least two orders of magnitude. We conclude that the estimation of N e / N ratios in natural populations could be significantly improved, discuss several options for doing so, and briefly outline some future research directions.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The estimates were obtained using inventory data collected every 5 years from 1985 to 2000, including measurements of all trees ≥ 1 cm diameter. Four different allometric regressions relating trunk diameter and height with AGB were compared. Based on the most consistent method, we estimated that the Barro Colorado forest holds 281 ± 20 Mg ha −1 (1 Mg = 10 3 kg) of AGB, lianas included. A third of the AGB is stored in trees larger than 70 cm in diameter. Stand‐level AGB increment (growth plus recruitment) was highest in the period 1985–90 (7.05 ± 0.32 Mg ha −1 year −1 , mean ± 95% confidence limits based on samples of multiple hectares) and smallest in the period 1990–95 (5.25 ± 0.26 Mg ha −1 year −1 ), while AGB losses were similar during the three intervals (mean 5.43 ± 0.72 Mg ha −1 year −1 ). This resulted in significant differences in AGB change (defined as increment minus loss) among census intervals; including branchfalls, the AGB of Barro Colorado Island increased in 1985–90 (+0.82 ± 0.84 Mg ha −1 year −1 ), decreased in 1990–95 (−0.69 ± 0.82 Mg ha −1 year −1 ), and increased again in 1995–2000 (+0.45 ± 0.70 Mg ha −1 year −1 ). The 15‐year average was +0.20 Mg ha −1 year −1 , but with a confidence interval that spanned zero (−0.68 to 0.63 Mg ha −1 year −1 ). Branchfalls and partial breakage of stems had a significant influence on the AGB changes. They contributed an average of 0.46 Mg ha −1 year −1 to the AGB loss. About 5% of AGB increment was due to trees less than 10 cm in diameter. To test whether the AGB of tropical forests is increasing due to climate change, we propose that in each forest type, at least 10 hectares of forest be inventoried, and that measurements of the small classes (&lt; 10 cm diameter) as well as large size classes be included. Biomass loss due to crown damage should also be estimated.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We inventoried the larval midgut bacteria of a polyphagous foliivore, the gypsy moth ( Lymantria dispar L.), whose gut is highly alkaline, by using traditional culturing and culture-independent methods. We also examined the effects of diet on microbial composition. Analysis of individual third-instar larvae revealed a high degree of similarity of microbial composition among insects fed on the same diet. DNA sequence analysis indicated that most of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes belong to the γ- Proteobacteria and low G+C gram-positive divisions and that the cultured members represented more than half of the phylotypes identified. Less frequently detected taxa included members of the α- Proteobacterium , Actinobacterium , and Cytophaga / Flexibacter / Bacteroides divisions. The 16S rRNA gene sequences from 7 of the 15 cultured organisms and 8 of the 9 sequences identified by PCR amplification diverged from previously reported bacterial sequences. The microbial composition of midguts differed substantially among larvae feeding on a sterilized artificial diet, aspen, larch, white oak, or willow. 16S rRNA analysis of cultured isolates indicated that an Enterococcus species and culture-independent analysis indicated that an Entbacter sp. were both present in all larvae, regardless of the feeding substrate; the sequences of these two phylotypes varied less than 1% among individual insects. These results provide the first comprehensive description of the microbial diversity of a lepidopteran midgut and demonstrate that the plant species in the diet influences the composition of the gut bacterial community.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We examine two interpolation methods to create a bridge between years, one that relies only on areal weighting and another that also introduces population weights. Results demonstrate that these approaches produce substantially different estimates for variables that involve population counts, but they have a high degree of convergence for variables defined as rates or averages. Finally the paper describes the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB), through which we are making available public-use tools to implement these methods to create estimates within 2010 tract boundaries for any tract-level data (from the census or other sources) that are available for prior years as early as 1970.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

This phenomenon underlies both prion-based inheritance in yeast and aggregation of a number of proteins involved in human neurodegenerative diseases. To examine the prevalence of this phenomenon, complete proteomic sequences of 31 organisms and several incomplete proteomic sequences were examined for Q/N-rich regions. We found that Q/N-rich regions are essentially absent from the thermophilic bacterial and archaeal proteomes. Moreover, the average Q/N content of the proteins in these organisms is markedly lower than in mesophilic bacteria and eukaryotes. Mesophilic bacterial proteomes contain a small number (0-4) of proteins with Q/N-rich regions. Remarkably, Q/N-rich domains are found in a much larger number of eukaryotic proteins (107-472 per proteome) with diverse biochemical functions. Analyses of these regions argue they have been evolutionarily selected perhaps as modular ""polar zipper"" protein-protein interaction domains. These data also provide a large pool of potential novel prion-forming proteins, two of which have recently been shown to behave as prions in yeast, thus suggesting that aggregation or prion-like regulation of protein function may be a normal regulatory process for many eukaryotic proteins with a wide variety of functions.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The analysis uses a sociology of knowledge perspective which assumes that race is an ideological concept that can be interpreted most productively by relating its definition and measurement to the larger social and political context. Four themes are identified and discussed: (i) the historical and continuing importance of skin colour, usually dichotomized into white and non‐white, in defining race and counting racial groups; (ii) a belief in 'pure' races that is reflected in a preoccupation with categorizing people into a single or 'pure' race; (iii) the role of census categories in creating pan‐ethnic racial groups; and, (iv) the confusing of race and ethnicity in census racial classifications. Each theme demonstrates the potential or actual role of official statistics, exemplified by census racial data, in reflecting and guiding changes to the meaning and social perceptions of race. A detailed examination of racial classifications from the 1980 and 1990 Censuses shows that the influence of political interests on racial statistics is particularly important. The article concludes with a discussion of whether official statistical recorders such as population censuses should categorize and measure race, given the political motivations and non‐scientific character of the classifications used.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Most of its data are collected by use of periodic censuses and more frequent sample surveys. Some data are produced by statistical modeling and estimation. The data products of the Census Bureau are primarily either counts of units in an entire universe being studied or characteristics of these units. This article provides selected historical highlights of the Census Bureau and its censuses and sample surveys and associated details of its demographic and economic data programs.,group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

A global night-time image product was registered to a dataset of 2000 known city locations with known populations. A relationship between areal extent and city population discovered by Tobler and Nordbeck is identified on a nation by nation basis to estimate the population of the 22 920 urban clusters that exist in the night-time satellite image. The relationship between city population and city areal extent was derived from 1597 city point locations with known population that landed in a 'lit' area of the image. Due to conurbation, these 1597 cities resulted in only 1383 points of analysis for performing regression. When several cities fell into one 'lit' area their populations were summed. The results of this analysis allow for an estimate of the urban population of every nation of the world. By using the known percent of population in urban areas for every nation a total national population was also estimated. The sum of these estimates is a total estimate of the global human population, which in this case was 6.3 billion. This is fairly close to the generally accepted contemporaneous (1997) estimate of the global population which stood at approximately 5.9 billion.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We exploit the LambdaR parameter to characterise the existence of two families of ETGs: Slow Rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fields and often include stellar kinematically Distinct Cores (KDCs), and Fast Rotators which have regular velocity fields. Our complete sample of 260 ETGs leads to a new criterion to disentangle Fast and Slow Rotators which now includes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (Epsilon). It separates the two classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than a criterion based on V/Sigma: Slow Rotators and Fast Rotators have LambdaR lower and larger than kFSxSQRT(Epsilon), respectively, where kFS=0.31 for measurements made within 1 Re. We show that the vast majority of early-type galaxies are Fast Rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with aligned photometric and kinematic axes (Paper II, Krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discs and often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in the volume-limited ATLAS3D sample. Fast Rotators span the full range of apparent ellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsic ellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologies consistent with spiral galaxies. Only a small fraction of ETGs are Slow Rotators representing 14% (36/260) of the ATLAS3D sample of ETGs. Of all Slow Rotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like components and are rather low mass objects (Mdyn&lt;10^10.5 M_Sun). All other Slow Rotators (32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (Epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive (Mdyn&gt;10^10.5 M_Sun), and often (17/32) exhibit KDCs.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

It uses data from two instruments on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite: near-surface precipitation radar (PR) reflectivities, and TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) 85.5-GHz polarization corrected temperatures (PCTs). These features were classified by size and intensity criteria to identify mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), precipitation with PCTs below 250 K, and other features without PCTs below 250 K. By using this technique, several hypotheses about the convective intensity and rainfall distributions of tropical precipitation systems can be evaluated. It was shown that features over land were much more intense than similar oceanic features as measured by their minimum PCTs, maximum heights of the 30-dBZ contour, and 6-km reflectivities. The diurnal cycle of precipitation features showed a strong afternoon maximum over land and a rather flat distribution over the ocean, quite similar to those found by others using infrared satellite techniques. Precipitation features with MCSs over the ocean contained significantly more rain outside the 250-K PCT isotherm than land systems, and in general, a significant portion (10%–15%) of rainfall in the Tropics falls in systems containing no PCTs less than 250 K. Volumetric rainfall and lightning characteristics (as observed by the Lightning Imaging Sensor aboard TRMM) from the systems were classified by feature intensity; similar rain amounts but highly differing lightning flash rates were found among the regions. Oceanic storms have a bimodal contribution of rainfall from two types of systems: very weak systems with little ice scattering and moderately strong systems that do not produce high lightning flash rates. Continental systems that produce the bulk of the rainfall (as sampled) are likely to have higher lightning flash rates, which are shown to be linked to stronger radar and ice-scattering intensities.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Abstract We present high spatial resolution (0.35 and 0.65 arcsec full width at half maximum (FWHM)) near-infrared images of the central 0.2x0.2 pc of the Trapezium Cluster in the Orion Nebula, centered on the Trapezium OB stars. These images provide the most complete census of stars in this region, and we give accurate positions and near-infrared (2.1 microns) magnitudes for 123 stars. After accounting for line-of-sight projection, we estimate a stellar density for the cluster of approximately 4.7 X 104 stars per cubic parsec in the approximately 0.1 pc diameter core. We identify stellar counterparts to virtually all the known dense knots of ionized gas seen at optical and radio wavelengths, strongly supporting the hypothesis that many are either intrinsic stellar radio emitters or circumstellar disks around stars, and not simply dense clumps of gas and dust. We derive approximate masses for the stars associated with the compact knots, finding that the majority are relatively low mass.

This survey has yielded 39 spectra of z_em ~ 0.5 QSOs with S/N ~ 10-15 per resolution element. The QSO sightlines pass within 150 physical kpc of the galaxies, which span early and late types over stellar mass log M* / Msun= 9.5 - 11.5. We find that the CGM exhibits strong HI, averaging 1 Ang in Lya equivalent width out to 150 kpc, with 100% covering fraction for star-forming galaxies and 75% covering for passive galaxies. We find good agreement in column densities between this survey and previous studies over similar range of impact parameter. There is weak evidence for a difference between early- and late-type galaxies in the strength and distribution of HI. Kinematics indicate that the detected material is bound to the host galaxy, such that >~90% of the detected column density is confined within +/-200 km s^-1 of the galaxies. This material generally exists well below the halo virial temperatures at T<~ 10^5 K. We evaluate a number of possible origin scenarios for the detected material, and in the end favor a simple model in which the bulk of the detected HI arises in a bound, cool, low-density photoionized diffuse medium that is generic to all L* galaxies and may harbor a total gaseous mass comparable to galactic stellar masses.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Current estimates of global species richness are highly uncertain, and the importance of stochastic vs. deterministic forces in the assembly of fungal communities is unknown. Molecular studies have so far failed to reach saturated, comprehensive estimates of fungal diversity. To obtain a more accurate estimate of global fungal diversity, we used a direct molecular approach to census diversity in a boreal ecosystem with precisely known plant diversity, and we carefully evaluated adequacy of sampling and accuracy of species delineation. We achieved the first exhaustive enumeration of fungi in soil, recording 1002 taxa in this system. We show that the fungus : plant ratio in Picea mariana forest soils from interior Alaska is at least 17:1 and is regionally stable. A global extrapolation of this ratio would suggest 6 million species of fungi, as opposed to leading estimates ranging from 616 000 to 1.5 million. We also find that closely related fungi often occupy divergent niches. This pattern is seen in fungi spanning all major functional guilds and four phyla, suggesting a major role of deterministic niche partitioning in community assembly. Extinctions and range shifts are reorganizing biodiversity on Earth, yet our results suggest that 98% of fungi remain undescribed and that many of these species occupy unique niches.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The impact of the US Supreme Court hearing and decision in Wisconsin vs New York is discussed followed by an analysis of the Census Bureaus plans for the Census in 2000. Census procedures have been challenged since 1988. Litigation forced the use of the Post Enumeration Survey for adjusting the 1990 Census but the Census Director in 1991 issued a recommendation for not adjusting the 1990 counts that was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in April 1993. Oral arguments were heard in the aforementioned New York case on January 10 1996. New York argued for the implementation of dual system estimation due to undercounting errors that were probably influenced by actions of Republican Commerce officials during the 1980s that prevented improvements in census counting. It was charged that Census Bureau methods violated the intent of Article 1 Section 2 of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection. Lawsuits challenged the Bureau to develop methods that would reduce the undercount of minorities and the urban poor. Other arguments of the state of Oklahoma Wisconsin the federal government for the Secretary of Commerce and New York City are summarized. The Solicitor General of the US Drew Days argued that the true total population of the US was unknown and unknowable and that the Secretary of Commerce had the authority to make decisions about the census. The main issue before the court became who had the authority to decide not to adjust. All of the US Supreme Court judges voted on March 20 1996 in favor of unadjusted census counts. The issue of statistical adjustment methods as a violation of the Constitution was not decided. Plans for the census of 2000 include reducing costs and increasing accuracy through a three-stage count strategy.,group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

I have used these spectroscopic data and all other available constraints to evaluate the spectral classifications and membership status of a total sample of 288 candidate members of Chamaeleon I that have appeared in published studies of the cluster. The latest census of Chamaeleon I now contains 158 members, eight of which are later than M6 and thus are likely to be brown dwarfs. I find that many of the objects identified as members of Chamaeleon I in recent surveys are actually field stars. Meanwhile, seven of nine candidates discovered by Carpenter and coworkers are confirmed as members, one of which is the coolest known member of Chamaeleon I at a spectral type of M8 (~0.03 M☉). I have estimated extinctions, luminosities, and effective temperatures for the members and used these data to construct an H-R diagram for the cluster. Chamaeleon I has a median age of ~2 Myr according to evolutionary models and hence is similar in age to IC 348 and is slightly older than Taurus (~1 Myr). The measurement of an initial mass function for Chamaeleon I from this census is not possible because of the disparate methods with which the known members were originally selected and must await an unbiased, magnitude-limited survey of the cluster.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Results indicate a moderate level of overall accuracy, and the model is more than 90% accurate in distinguishing areas of heavy reinvestment from stable, middle-class districts.

These techniques are demonstrated with 1980-2000 census data from the 13-county Atlanta metropolitan area. Land-use/land-cover data derived from remotely sensed satellite imagery were used to determine the areal extent of populated areas, which in turn served as the denominator for dasymetric population density computations at the census tract level. The dasymetric method accounts for the spatial distribution of population within administrative areas, yielding more precise population density estimates than the choroplethic method, while graphically representing the geographic distribution of populations. In order to areally interpolate census data from one set of census tract boundaries to another, the percentages of populated areas affected by boundary changes in each affected tract were used as adjustment weights for census data at the census tract level, where census tract boundary shifts made temporal data comparisons difficult. This method of areal interpolation made it possible to represent three years of census data (1980, 1990, and 2000) in one set of common census tracts (1990). Accuracy assessment of the dasymetrically derived adjustment weights indicated a satisfactory level of accuracy. Dasymetrically derived areal interpolation weights can be applied to any type of geographic boundary re-aggregation, such as from census tracts to zip code tabulation areas, from census tracts to local school districts, from zip code areas to telephone exchange prefix areas, and for electoral redistricting.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,
,A census-based estimate of Earth's bacterial and archaeal diversity,,Stilianos Louca,Stilianos Louca; Florent Mazel; Michael Doebeli; Laura Wegener Parfrey,A census-based estimate of Earth's bacterial and archaeal diversity,census; estimate; earth; diversity,2019.0,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000106,"The global diversity of Bacteria and Archaea, the most ancient and most widespread forms of life on Earth, is a subject of intense controversy. This controversy stems largely from the fact that existing estimates are entirely based on theoretical models or extrapolations from small and biased data sets. Here, in an attempt to census the bulk of Earth's bacterial and archaeal (""prokaryotic"") clades and to estimate their overall global richness, we analyzed over 1.7 billion 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequences in the V4 hypervariable region obtained from 492 studies worldwide, covering a multitude of environments and using multiple alternative primers. From this data set, we recovered 739,880 prokaryotic operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 16S-V4 gene clusters at 97% similarity), a commonly used measure of microbial richness. Using several statistical approaches, we estimate that there exist globally about 0.8-1.6 million prokaryotic OTUs, of which we recovered somewhere between 47%-96%, representing >99.98% of prokaryotic cells. Consistent with this conclusion, our data set independently ""recaptured"" 91%-93% of 16S sequences from multiple previous global surveys, including PCR-independent metagenomic surveys. The distribution of relative OTU abundances is consistent with a log-normal model commonly observed in larger organisms; the total number of OTUs predicted by this model is also consistent with our global richness estimates. By combining our estimates with the ratio of full-length versus partial-length (V4) sequence diversity in the SILVA sequence database, we further estimate that there exist about 2.2-4.3 million full-length OTUs worldwide. When restricting our analysis to the Americas, while controlling for the number of studies, we obtain similar richness estimates as for the global data set, suggesting that most OTUs are globally distributed. Qualitatively similar results are also obtained for other 16S similarity thresholds (90%, 95%, and 99%). Our estimates constrain the extent of a poorly quantified rare microbial biosphere and refute recent predictions that there exist trillions of prokaryotic OTUs.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Now, the total number of spectroscopically confirmed LAEs is 45 and 54 at z=6.5 and 5.7, respectively, and at least 81% (70%) of our photometric candidates at z=6.5 (5.7) have been spectroscopically identified as real LAEs. We made careful measurements of the Ly-alpha luminosity, both photometrically and spectroscopically, to accurately determine the Ly-alpha and rest-UV luminosity functions (LFs). The substantially improved evaluation of the Ly-alpha LF at z=6.5 shows an apparent deficit from z=5.7 at least at the bright end, and a possible decline even at the faint end, though small uncertainties remain. The rest-UV LFs at z=6.5 and 5.7 are in good agreement, at least at the bright end, in clear contrast to the differences seen in the Ly-alpha LF. These results imply an increase in the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium from z=5.7 to 6.5. The rest-frame equivalent width (EW_0) distribution at z=6.5 seems to be systematically smaller than z=5.7, and it shows an extended tail toward larger EW_0. The bright end of the rest-UV LF can be reproduced from the observed Ly-alpha LF and a reasonable EW_0-UV luminosity relation. Integrating this rest-UV LF provides the first measurement of the contribution of LAEs to the photon budget required for reionization. The derived UV LF suggests that the fractional contribution of LAEs to the photon budget among Lyman break galaxies significantly increases towards faint magnitudes. Low-luminosity LAEs could dominate the ionizing photon budget, though this inference depends strongly on the uncertain faint-end slope of the Ly-alpha LF.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

These recent colonizations represent ∼5% of the increase in known breeding population and provide insight into the ability of these highly philopatric seabirds to colonize new breeding territories. Additionally, we report on 13 colonies not found in the survey, including 8 that we conclude have gone extinct. We find that Adélie Penguin declines on the Antarctic Peninsula are more than offset by increases in East Antarctica. Our global population assessment provides a robust baseline for understanding future changes in abundance and distribution.

A Pacific basin‐wide three‐dimensional physical‐biogeochemical model has been developed and the result in the SCS subdomain is used to quantify the eddy activities during the period of 1993–2007. The modeled results are compared with a merged and gridded satellite product of sea level anomaly by using the same eddy identification and tracking method. On average, there are about 32.9 ± 2.4 eddies predicted by the model and 32.8 ± 3.4 eddies observed by satellite each year, and about 52% of them are cyclonic eddies. The radius of these eddies ranges from about 46.5 to 223.5 km, with a mean value of 87.4 km. More than 70% of the eddies have a radius smaller than 100 km. The mean area covered by these eddies each year is around 160,170 km 2 , equivalent to 9.8% of the SCS area with water depths greater than 1000 m. Linear relationships are found between eddy lifetime and eddy magnitude and between eddy vertical extent and eddy magnitude, showing that strong eddies usually last longer and penetrate deeper than weak ones. Interannual variations in eddy numbers and the total eddy‐occupied area indicate that eddy activities in the SCS do not directly correspond to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation events. The wind stress curls are thought to be an important but not the only mechanism of eddy genesis in the SCS.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

National population and housing census data can be outdated, inaccurate, or missing key groups or areas, while registry data are generally lacking or incomplete. Moreover, at local scales accurate boundary data are often limited, and high rates of migration and urban growth make existing data quickly outdated. Here we review past and ongoing work aimed at producing spatially disaggregated local-scale population estimates, and discuss how new technologies are now enabling robust and cost-effective solutions. Recent advances in the availability of detailed satellite imagery, geopositioning tools for field surveys, statistical methods, and computational power are enabling the development and application of approaches that can estimate population distributions at fine spatial scales across entire countries in the absence of census data. We outline the potential of such approaches as well as their limitations, emphasizing the political and operational hurdles for acceptance and sustainable implementation of new approaches, and the continued importance of traditional sources of national statistical data.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

All 1200 actively practicing North American boardcertified ASAPS members were polled by facsimile, then mail, regarding deaths after liposuction. Patient initials together with case summaries precluded data replication yet assured patient anonymity and preserved surgeon privacy. Incomplete returns or ambiguous findings were authenticated, where feasible, by direct follow-up. Total number of lipoplasties performed by plastic surgeons was interpolated from the ASPRS procedure database for the survey time frame of 1994 to mid-1998. Lacking reliable annual case volume estimates, deaths from lipoplasties performed by non-ABPS surgeons were excluded from the actual mortality rate computation but were included in cause-of-death ranking statistics. Responding aesthetic plastic surgeons (917 of 1200) reported 95 uniquely authenticated fatalities in 496,245 lipoplasties. In this census survey, the mortality rate computed to 1 in 5224, or 19.1 per 100,000. A virtually identical 20.3 per 100,000 mortality rate was obtained in a 1997 random survey commissioned by the parent society. Pulmonary thromboembolism remains as the major killer (23.4 ± 2.6 percent); lacking consistent medical examiners' toxicology data, the putative role of high-dose lidocaine cardiotoxicity could not be ascertained. Where so stated, many deaths occurred during the first night after discharge home; prudence suggests vigilant observation for residual ""hangover"" from sedative/anesthetic drugs after lengthy procedures. Taken together, these two independent surveys peg the late 1990s mortality rate from liposuction at about 20 per 100,000, or 1 in every 5000 procedures. Set beside the 16.4 per 100,000 fatality rates of U.S. motor vehicle accidents, liposuction is not an altogether benign procedure.

We conclude that the diversity of diazotrophs is still poorly described and that many organisms remain to be discovered. Our analyses indicate that diversity is not distributed evenly across phylogenetic groups or across environments and that some of the most diverse assemblages and environments remain the most poorly characterized. The majority of OTUs were rare, falling in the long tail of the frequency distribution. The most dominant OTUs fell into either the Cyanobacteria or the α , β , and γ Proteobacteria , and five of these dominant OTUs do not have any representatives cultivated in isolation. Soils contained the greatest diversity of nifH sequences of all of the environments surveyed. Cluster III, which is dominated by nifH sequences from obligate anaerobes, was found to contain the greatest diversity of all nifH lineages and is also the group for which diversity is the least sampled.

But little empirical attention has been paid to how well this aggregate information serves as a proxy for the individual characteristics of interest. We build on recent work addressing the biases inherent in proxies and consider two health-related examples within a statistical framework that illuminates the nature and sources of biases. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey are linked to census data. We assess the validity of using the aggregate census information as a proxy for individual information when estimating main effects and when controlling for potential confounding between socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors in measures of general health status and infant mortality. We find a general, but not universal, tendency for aggregate proxies to exaggerate the effects of micro-level variables and to do more poorly than micro-level variables at controlling for confounding. The magnitude and direction of these biases vary across samples, however. Our statistical framework and empirical findings suggest the difficulties in and limits to interpreting proxies derived from aggregate census data as if they were micro-level variables. The statistical framework that we outline for our study of health outcomes should be generally applicable to other situations where researchers have merged aggregate data with microdata samples.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Our primary objective was to assess whether annual variation in abundances and persistence of populations within woodlots was related to variation in reproductive success. Nesting success of migrants was so low in the woodlots where we sampled that it is unlikely that these populations are self—sustaining. Moreover, populations frequently disappear from and recolonize these woodlots. These data suggest that the source—sink metaphor for population dynamics within spatially structured populations is applicable to migratory birds in Illinois. The scale of this dynamic is unknown, but may be regional (i.e., midwestern U.S.). An important implication of this result is that census data must be interpreted carefully. For one woodlot, we detected no systematic trend in the overall abundances of migratory birds over much of the 20th century. Yet the viability of populations within that woodlot likely decreased dramatically over that time owing to increasing rates of nest predation and brood parasitism. Lack of data on dispersal is a major gap in understanding the population dynamics of Neotropical migrants and prescribing effective conservation measures.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

A computer simulation of the capture–recapture process was used to examine the influence of five population parameters on the reliability of enumeration. Enumeration is shown to be insensitive to population size, survival between sampling intervals, and individual variation in the probability of capture. Enumeration is sensitive to the probability of capture; if the probability of capture for the average individual falls below 0.5, the enumeration technique provides a poor estimate of population size. Enumeration is also extremely sensitive to reduced probabilities of capture for unmarked animals. Data from capture–recapture studies of five species of Microtus were used in the computer simulation, and it was concluded for these five species that enumerated populations are at least 10–20% smaller than the actual populations.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

As of February 2002, 230 articles were indexed by zip code in PubMed,1 all published since 1989. Fifty-two of these articles (23%) involved the use of censusderived zip code socioeconomic data (e.g., median household income) to investigate the effects of socioeconomic position on specified health outcomes (article citations are available on request from the authors). To date, discussions regarding the use of zip code socioeconomic data for US public health research have focused chiefly on whether zip codes' larger population size (average: 30 000) and potentially greater socioeconomic heterogeneity would attenuate estimates of socioeconomic gradients in health detected using zip codes in comparison with estimates obtained via census tract (average population: 4000) or block group (average population: 1000) socioeconomic data.2–7 Unacknowledged in the public health literature, however, is the fact that zip codes differ from census tracts and block groups in other important ways, including spatiotemporal definition and stability. Unlike census tracts, defined by the US Bureau of the Census as “small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision[s] of a county . . . designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions,”8(ppG-10–G-11) zip codes are “administrative units established by the United States Postal Service . . . for the most efficient delivery of mail, and therefore generally do not respect political or census statistical area boundaries.”9(pA-13) Spanning in size from a single building or company with a high volume of mail to large areas that cut across states, “carrier routes for one zip code may intertwine with those of one or more zip codes” such that “this area is more conceptual than geographic.”10 To “overcome the difficulties in precisely defining the land area covered by each zip code,”11 the US Census Bureau created a new statistical entity built from census blocks: the 5-digit zip code tabulation area (ZCTA), first used in the 2000 census.12 Of note, ZCTAs and zip codes sharing the same 5-digit code may not necessarily cover the same area (Table 1 ▶),13 so that zip codes obtained via self-report or from addresses in medical records cannot be assumed to correspond to census-defined ZCTAs. TABLE 1 —Technical Definitions of and Distinctions Between Zip Codes and Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) Even before introduction of the ZCTAs, there were 2 types of spatiotemporal discontinuity that could conceivably affect health studies linking zip codes to census-derived data: (1) changes in zip code delivery routes—and hence in population covered by the affected zip code—and (2) discontinuation and addition of zip codes in nondecennial years.14–16 Between 1997 and 2001 alone, the US Post Office added approximately 390 new zip codes nationwide and discontinued 120 (oral communication, Meg Ausman, US Post Office Data Center, February 5, 2002). One implication of these changes is that persons could be correctly geocoded to a zip code that did not exist in the preceding decennial census. Findings from the Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project17 illustrate the potential problems for health research of spatiotemporal zip code–census mismatches, even those dating from before the creation of ZCTAs. This project was designed to assess which area-based socioeconomic measures at which levels of geography (census tract, block group, and zip code) are most appropriate for monitoring socioeconomic inequalities in health. Health data from 2 states (Massachusetts and Rhode Island) and the 1990 census were used. Records were geocoded in 1999 by a firm whose accuracy we ascertained to be high (96%),18 and the firm, following standard practice, returned the most recent geocodes available. Cancer incidence rates were one of the health outcomes addressed. We found that in Massachusetts (474 zip codes listed in the 1990 census), 17 376 (10.4%) of the 166 730 cancer cases occurring during 1987 to 1993 were geocoded to 193 zip codes not included in the 1990 census; 15 774 (90.8%) of these 17 376 cases were in one of 30 zip codes changed or established after the 1990 census.19–21 By contrast, in Rhode Island (70 zip codes listed in the 1990 census), only 0.7% (148) of the 19 766 geocoded cancer incidence records were matched to zip codes not included in the 1990 census. In the case of colon cancer incidence in Massachusetts, moreover, the impact of excluding persons linked to zip codes not included in the 1990 census was substantial. Zip code–level analyses yielded socioeconomic gradients contrary to those observed via data at the tract and block group levels and contrary to those reported in the literature (Tables 2–4 ▶ ▶ ▶).22 TABLE 2 —Incident Colon Cancer Counts by Geographic Level: Massachusetts, 1987–1993 TABLE 3 —Colon Cancer Incidence Rates, Stratified by Area-Based Socioeconomic Measures, Among Persons in Areas With the Least and Most Resources, Along With Age-Adjusted Comparisons (Incidence Rate Ratio and Relative Index of Inequality): Massachusetts, ... TABLE 4 —Area-Based Socioeconomic Measures and Cutpoints Used in Data Analysis Given the growing interest in linking geographic and health data,23,24 we urge researchers, when using geocoded records, to pay careful attention to the potential for spatiotemporal mismatches between censusderived and zip code data as well as to changes in zip code boundaries and years in which boundaries were established. Public health projects and programs that use zip code data should likewise be alert to potential new issues stemming from the replacement of zip codes with ZCTAs in the 2000 census.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The Census Bureau has dealt with this problem, which has been increasing in severity over time, by imputing incomes of non-respondents. Their imputation procedure, called the ""hot deck,"" essentially matches nonrespondents with demographically similar donors. In this paper we evaluate the census imputation methodology and raise some questions. First, the census procedure is tied to commonality of events in the population rather than the more appropriate informational content of regressors. Clearly, the census procedure severely understates income in certain occupations. Because it is based on the apparently invalid assumption that income does not affect reporting propensities, it most likely understates average incomes as well.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Knowing the ratio of effective to census size, N e / N , is useful for estimating the effective size of a population from census data and for examining how different ecological factors influence effective size. Two different multigenerational ratios have been used in the literature based on either the arithmetic mean or the harmonic mean in the denominator. We clarify the interpretation and meaning of these ratios. The arithmetic mean N e / N ratio compares the total number of real individuals to the long‐term effective size of the population. The harmonic mean N e / N ratio summarizes variation in the N e / N ratio for each generation. In addition, we show that the ratio of the harmonic mean population size to the arithmetic mean population size provides a useful measure of how much fluctuation in size reduced the effective size of a population. We discuss applications of these ratios and emphasize how to use the harmonic mean N e / N ratio to estimate the effective size of a population over a period of time for which census counts have been collected.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

While the number of Internet hosts is very large, and many are hidden behind firewalls or in private address space, there is much to be learned from examining the population of visible hosts, those with public unicast addresses that respond to messages. In this paper we introduce two new approaches to explore the visible Internet. Applying statistical population sampling, we use censuses to walk the entire Internet address space, and surveys to probe frequently a fraction of that space. We then use these tools to evaluate address usage, where we find that only 3.6% of allocated addresses are actually occupied by visible hosts, and that occupancy is unevenly distributed, with a quarter of responsive /24 address blocks (subnets) less than 5% full, and only 9% of blocks more than half full. We show about 34 million addresses are very stable and visible to our probes (about 16% of responsive addresses), and we project from this up to 60 million stable Internet-accessible computers. The remainder of allocated addresses are used intermittently, with a median occupancy of 81 minutes. Finally, we show that many firewalls are visible, measuring significant diversity in the distribution of firewalled block size. To our knowledge, we are the first to take a census of edge hosts in the visible Internet since 1982, to evaluate the accuracy of active probing for address census and survey, and to quantify these aspects of the Internet.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

This maximum likelihood method accommodates more than one planet per star and any number of planet or target star properties. Application to \Kepler data relies on estimates of the efficiency of discovering transits around Solar type stars by Howard et al. (2011). These estimates are shown to agree with theoretical predictions for an ideal transit survey. Using announced \Kepler planet candidates, we fit the PLDF as a joint powerlaw in planet radius, down to 0.5 R_Eart, and orbital period, up to 50 days. The estimated number of planets per star in this sample is ~ 0.7 --- 1.4, where the broad range covers systematic uncertainties in the detection efficiency. To analyze trends in the PLDF we consider four planet samples, divided between shorter and longer periods at 7 days and between large and small radii at 3 R_Earth. At longer periods, the size distribution of the small planets, with index \alpha = -1.2 \pm 0.2 steepens to \alpha = -2.0 \pm 0.2 for the larger planet sample. For shorter periods, the opposite is seen: smaller planets follow a steep powerlaw, \alpha = -1.9 \pm 0.2 that is much shallower, \alpha = -0.7 \pm 0.2 at large radii. The observed deficit of intermediate-sized planets at the shortest periods may arise from the evaporation and sublimation of Neptune and Saturn-like planets. If the trend and explanation hold, it would be spectacular observational confirmation of the core accretion and migration hypotheses, and allow refinement of these theories.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

These techniques, however, have inherent problems that make it difficult to collect accurate numerical data. One of these problems is the diver effect (defined as the reaction of fish to a diver). Although widely recognised, its effects have yet to be quantified and the extent of taxonomic variation remains to be determined. We therefore examined relative diver effects on a reef fish assemblage on the Great Barrier Reef. Using common UVC methods, the recorded abundance of seven reef fish groups were significantly affected by the ongoing presence of SCUBA divers. Overall, the diver effect resulted in a 52% decrease in the mean number of individuals recorded, with declines of up to 70% in individual families. Although the diver effect appears to be a significant problem, UVCs remain a useful approach for quantifying spatial and temporal variation in relative fish abundances, especially if using methods that minimise the exposure of fishes to divers. Fixed distance transects using tapes or lines deployed by a second diver (or GPS-calibrated timed swims) would appear to maximise fish counts and minimise diver effects.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We assessed how well the census of full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences is proceeding in the context of recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies because full-length sequences are typically used as references for classification of the short sequences generated by newer technologies. Among the 1,411,234 and 53,546 full-length bacterial and archaeal sequences, 94.5% and 95.1% of the bacterial and archaeal sequences, respectively, belonged to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that have been observed more than once. Although these metrics suggest that the census is approaching completion, 29.2% of the bacterial and 38.5% of the archaeal OTUs have been observed more than once. Thus, there is still considerable diversity to be explored. Unfortunately, the rate of new full-length sequences has been declining, and new sequences are primarily being deposited by a small number of studies. Furthermore, sequences from soil and aquatic environments, which are known to be rich in bacterial diversity, represent only 7.8 and 16.5% of the census, while sequences associated with host-associated environments represent 55.0% of the census. Continued use of traditional approaches and new technologies such as single-cell genomics and short-read assembly are likely to improve our ability to sample rare OTUs if it is possible to overcome this sampling bias. The success of ongoing efforts to use short-read sequencing to characterize archaeal and bacterial communities requires that researchers strive to expand the depth and breadth of this census.The biodiversity contained within the bacterial and archaeal domains dwarfs that of the eukaryotes, and the services these organisms provide to the biosphere are critical. Surprisingly, we have done a relatively poor job of formally tracking the quality of the biodiversity as represented in full-length 16S rRNA genes. By understanding how this census is proceeding, it is possible to suggest the best allocation of resources for advancing the census. We found that the ongoing effort has done an excellent job of sampling the most abundant organisms but struggles to sample the rarer organisms. Through the use of new sequencing technologies, we should be able to obtain full-length sequences from these rare organisms. Furthermore, we suggest that by allocating more resources to sampling environments known to have the greatest biodiversity, we will be able to make significant advances in our characterization of archaeal and bacterial diversity.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Most recent estimations, all based on indirect approaches, suggest that there are millions of marine eukaryotic species. Moreover, a large majority of these are small (less than 1 mm), cryptic and still unknown to science. However, this knowledge gap, caused by the lack of diagnostic morphological features in small organisms and the limited sampling of the global ocean, is currently being filled, thanks to new DNA-based approaches. The molecular technique of PCR amplification of homologous gene regions combined with high-throughput sequencing, routinely used to census unculturable prokaryotes, is now also being used to characterize whole communities of marine eukaryotes. Here, we review how this methodological advancement has helped to better quantify the magnitude and patterns of marine eukaryotic diversity, with an emphasis on taxonomic groups previously largely overlooked. We then discuss obstacles remaining to achieve a global understanding of marine eukaryotic diversity. In particular, we argue that 18S variable regions do not provide sufficient taxonomic resolution to census marine life, and suggest combining broad eukaryotic surveys targeting the 18S rRNA region with more taxon-focused analyses of hypervariable regions to improve our understanding of the diversity of species, the functional units of marine ecosystems.This article is part of the themed issue 'From DNA barcodes to biomes'.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We aim to conduct a blind, all-sky search for open clusters using 729 million sources from Gaia DR3 down to magnitude $G\sim20$, creating a homogeneous catalogue of clusters including many new objects. We used the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm to recover clusters. We validated our clusters using a statistical density test and a Bayesian convolutional neural network for colour-magnitude diagram classification. We inferred basic astrometric parameters, ages, extinctions, and distances for the clusters in the catalogue. We recovered 7167 clusters, 2387 of which are candidate new objects and 4782 of which crossmatch to objects in the literature, including 134 globular clusters. A more stringent cut of our catalogue contains 4105 highly reliable clusters, 739 of which are new.

Our cluster membership lists include many new members and often include tidal tails. Our catalogue's distribution traces the galactic warp, the spiral arm structure, and the dust distribution of the Milky Way.

Combining them and the spectra of the B stars from our previous investigations (∼430 cluster and ∼100 field B stars) yields a large, homogeneous sample for studying the rotational properties of B stars. We derive the projected rotational velocity Vsin i, effective temperature, gravity, mass, and critical rotation speed Vcrit for each star. We find that the average Vsin i is significantly lower among field stars because they are systematically more evolved and spun down than their cluster counterparts. The rotational distribution functions of Veq/Vcrit for the least evolved B stars show that lower mass B stars are born with a larger proportion of rapid rotators than higher mass B stars. However, the upper limit of Veq/Vcrit that may separate normal B stars from emission-line Be stars (where rotation promotes mass loss into a circumstellar disk) is smaller among the higher mass B stars. We compare the evolutionary trends of rotation (measured according to the polar gravity of the star) with recent models that treat internal mixing. The spin-down rates observed in the high-mass subset (∼9 M☉) agree with predictions, but the rates are larger for the low-mass group (∼3 M☉). The faster spin-down in the low-mass B stars matches well with the predictions based on conservation of angular momentum in individual spherical shells. Our results suggest that the fastest rotators (that probably correspond to the emission-line Be stars) are probably formed by evolutionary spin-up (for the more massive stars) and by mass transfer in binaries (for the full range of B star masses).",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

This research develops regression-based water demand models capable of forecasting single-family residential water demands within individual census tracts at a bimonthly time-step. The regression models are estimated using 12 years of demographic, weather, economic, and metered bimonthly water consumption data associated with over 100 unique census tracts in Seattle, Washington. In general, the three regression methods perform well in replicating total single-family water consumption in the study region. Two regression models, a fixed effects model and a random effects model, provide better estimates of water demand within individual census tracts. Improved water demand forecasts at the spatial scale of census tracts provide policy makers and planners information useful for managing water resources. These proposed approaches allow examination of spatially distributed demands within systems, identify the value of targeted conservation and infrastructure development, and improve understanding of the variables impacting demand in heterogeneous areas. The coefficient estimates developed in this research are appropriate for use in spatially disaggregate urban simulation models.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

This becomes highly problematic when these indices are used as the basis for allocating resources to local and health authorities. In order to ensure fairness and accuracy in resource allocation these indices should be both weighted and validated. STUDY RESULTS--Weightings are derived from the Breadline Britain in the 1990s survey to produce a census based deprivation index that estimates the percentage of poor households at electoral ward level. Examples of validation methodology are discussed and the estimate of the proportion of poor households is shown to be highly correlated with both low income and morbidity as estimated from the 1991 census. DATA SOURCES--The 1991 census local base statistics (LBS) and small area statistics (SAS) aggregated for the 8519 electoral wards of England.

Mobility increases and economic restructuring since the 1980s, however, call for new conceptualizations of migration. Using interprovincial migration data from China's 1990 and 2000 censuses, I analyze migration rates, migration effectiveness, population growth, net migration flows, and spatial focusing of migration. The analysis supports the notions that migration is an increasingly effective factor of population redistribution and that it has a strong relationship with regional development. While these relationships have been documented in many other parts of the world, they have been less well addressed in the case of China. Regional divergence in economic development during the 1990s was accompanied by a marked increase in interprovincial migration and sharply concentrated migration flows, especially from relatively poor central and western provinces to the rapidly growing eastern region. These results suggest that migration theories that draw from experiences of capitalist economies may be of increased relevance to China.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Pearson's correlation was computed to analyse the relationships among the variables. Further, factor analysis was conducted to extract unique information from the combined dataset. Three factors were identified and interpreted as material welfare, environmental conditions and crowdedness respectively. Each factor was viewed as a unique aspect of the quality of life. A synthetic index of the urban quality of life was created and mapped based on weighted factor scores of the three factors.

,A Census-Based Count of the Civil War Dead,,J. David Hacker,J. David Hacker,A Census-Based Count of the Civil War Dead,census; count; civil; war; dead,2011.0,10.1353/cwh.2011.0061,"A Census-Based Count of the Civil War Dead J. David Hacker (bio) Counting the Civil War Dead For more than five decades, Civil War History has served as the leading venue for scholarly publications on the Civil War era. Even in light of this impressive run, the editors of Civil War History feel that the following contribution by J. David Hacker of Binghamton University, SUNY, stands among the most consequential pieces ever to appear in this journal’s pages. Hacker, a specialist in quantitative methods, has utilized recently released microdata samples from nineteenth-century censuses to examine one of the archetypal “facts” about the Civil War—the oft-cited total of 620,000 plus deaths. Through a comparison of male survival rates between 1860 and 1870 with male survival rates in surrounding censuses, Hacker finds the traditional statistic understates the number of actual Civil War deaths by approximately 20 percent. In his estimation, the most probable number of deaths attributable to the Civil War is 752,000, although the upper bounds of his data set point to as many as 851,000 deaths. As an exercise in the recalculation of a statistic, “Counting the Civil War Dead” might be regarded by skeptics either as a form of what Thomas Kuhn [End Page 307] described as “normal science” or as a misleading evocation of numeracy that belies the constructed nature of statistics. Such readings, we believe, miss the mark. “Counting the Civil War Dead” does more than modify a hoary bit of Civil War trivia; instead, it implicitly asks us to consider several questions that lie at the heart of the modern historical enterprise. How do “facts” emerge and become accepted by the profession writ large? How does the inevitably limited nature of historical evidence constrain our thinking about the past—and can we ever transcend these limits? Simply put, can we ever count the Civil War dead? As readers will soon discover, the practical answer is no. The use of the most sophisticated tools of quantitative analysis can certainly overturn what was once accepted wisdom, but, in the final analysis, they can only provide us with a probabilistic range of excess male deaths during the 1860s.1 In a very real sense, however, fixating upon a precise number obscures the actual meaning of the numbers, as scholars such as William Blair, David Blight, Jane Turner Censer, Drew Gilpin Faust, Barbara Gannon, Caroline Janney, Stuart McConnell, and John Neff have clearly established the central roles occupied by loss and trauma in postbellum America. By placing the Civil War’s enormous death toll at the center of the postwar world, this generation of scholarship forces us to stop and reconsider the war’s meaning for period Americans. And since, as Hacker implies, the majority of the uncounted dead were likely southerners (thanks to deficiencies in Confederate record-keeping and the troubled postwar condition of the south), the “ghosts of the Confederacy” now seem more numerous and persistent than ever. In terms of the scale of the carnage, Richmond in 1865 was Paris in 1918. Thus, what you are about to read takes us to “the frontiers of historical imagination” (to borrow a phrase from Kerwin Klein) and serves as a reminder that for all we know about the Civil War, there is still plenty that we do not—and can never—know. To prepare us for this journey, James McPherson has graciously provided this commentary on Hacker’s work. [End Page 308] Commentary on “A Census-Based Count of the Civil War Dead” by James M. McPherson I have been waiting more than twenty-five years for an article like this one. As I was working on my two syntheses of the Civil War era, Ordeal by Fire and Battle Cry of Freedom, I became increasingly aware that the standard estimate of 258,000 Confederate war dead was a significant undercount. Many Confederate records were lost or incomplete, especially for the last—and bloodiest—year of the war. The number of disease-related deaths of Confederate soldiers was clearly underreported. There were no reported Confederate noncombat deaths from “miscellaneous” causes—accidents, drownings, causes not stated, et cetera—compared with nearly twenty...",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We present the first digital map of seafloor lithologies based on descriptions of nearly 14,500 samples from original cruise reports, interpolated using a support vector machine algorithm. We show that sediment distribution is more complex, with significant deviations from earlier hand-drawn maps, and that major lithologies occur in drastically different proportions globally. By coupling our digital map to oceanographic data sets, we find that the global occurrence of biogenic oozes is strongly linked to specific ranges in sea-surface parameters. In particular, by using recent computations of diatom distributions from pigment-calibrated chlorophyll-a satellite data, we show that, contrary to a widely held view, diatom oozes are not a reliable proxy for surface productivity. Their global accumulation is instead strongly dependent on low surface temperature (0.9–5.7 °C) and salinity (33.8–34.0 PSS, Practical Salinity Scale 1978) and high concentrations of nutrients. Under these conditions, diatom oozes will accumulate on the seafloor regardless of surface productivity as long as there is limited competition from biogenous and detrital components, and diatom frustules are not significantly dissolved prior to preservation. Quantifying the link between the seafloor and the sea surface through the use of large digital data sets will ultimately lead to more robust reconstructions and predictions of climate change and its impact on the ocean environment.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Recent developments allow wildlife researchers to obtain genetic material via non‐invasive sampling techniques that may provide the large sample sizes necessary for precise estimates of N e and N c . Population genetic theory provides several methods to estimate N e from allele frequency data: including temporal change in allele frequencies, gametic disequilibrium and heterozygote excess methods. Modification of capture–mark–recapture methods for use with multi‐locus genotype data provides new means for estimating N c . The combination of new DNA sampling techniques, polymerase chain reaction‐based DNA markers and analytical methods may provide unprecedented power to detect reductions in N e and N c of endangered populations. However, these genetic methods are largely untested in the field. We review some relatively unexplored, but promising ways that multi‐locus genetic data can be used to provide important genetic and demographic information and suggest avenues for further research in this area.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The PES was a stratified block sample with heavy emphasis placed on hard-to-count population groups. Matching the individuals in the census to the individuals in the PES is an important aspect of census coverage evaluation and consequently a very important process for any census adjustment operations that might be planned. For such an adjustment to be feasible, record-linkage software had to be developed that could perform matches with a high degree of accuracy and that was based on an underlying mathematical theory. A principal purpose of the PES was to provide an opportunity to evaluate the newly implemented record-linkage system and associated methodology. This article discusses the theoretical and practical issues encountered in conducting the matching operation and presents the results of that operation. A review of the theoretical background of the record-linkage problem provides a framework for discussions of the decision procedure, file blocking, and the independence assumption. The estimation of the parameters required by the decision procedure is an important aspect of the methodology, and the techniques presented provide a practical system that is easily implemented. The matching algorithm (discussed in detail) uses the linear sum assignment model to ""pair"" the records. The Tampa, Florida, matching methodology is described in the final sections of the article.

White,A census of metals and baryons in stars in the local Universe,census; metals; baryons; stars; universe,2007.0,10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12632.x,"We combine stellar metallicity and stellar mass estimates for a large sample of galaxies drawn from the SDSS DR2 spanning wide ranges in physical properties, in order to derive an inventory of the total mass of metals and baryons locked up in stars today. Physical parameter estimates are derived from galaxy spectra with high S/N (>20). Coadded spectra of galaxies with similar velocity dispersions, absolute r-band magnitudes and 4000\AA-break values are used for those regions of parameter space where individual spectra have lower S/N. We estimate the total density of metals and of baryons in stars and, from these two quantities, we obtain a mass- and volume-averaged stellar metallicity of <Z_star>=1.04+-0.14 Z_sun, i.e. consistent with solar. We also study how metals are distributed in galaxies according to their mass, morphology and age, and we then compare these distributions with the corresponding distributions of stellar mass. We find that the bulk of metals locked up in stars in the local Universe reside in massive, bulge-dominated galaxies, with red colours and high 4000\AA-break values corresponding to old stellar populations. Bulge-dominated and disc-dominated galaxies contribute similar amounts to the total stellar mass density, but have different fractional contributions to the mass density of metals in stars, in agreement with the mass-metallicity relation. Bulge-dominated galaxies contain roughly 40% of the total amount of metals in stars, while disc-dominated galaxies less than 25%. Finally, at a given galaxy stellar mass, we define two characteristic ages as the median of the distributions of mass and metals as a function of age. These characteristic ages decrease progressively from high-mass to low-mass galaxies, consistent with the high formation epochs of stars in massive galaxies.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

A total of 24,400 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones were screened for 16S rRNA genes. The sequences obtained from BAC clones were compared with a collection generated by direct PCR amplification and cloning of 16S rRNA genes from the same soil. The results indicated that the BAC library had substantially lower representation of bacteria among the Bacillus , α- Proteobacteria , and CFB groups; greater representation among the β- and γ- Proteobacteria , and OP10 divisions; and no rRNA genes from the domains Eukaryota and Archaea . In addition to rRNA genes recovered from the bacterial divisions Proteobacteria , Verrucomicrobia , Firmicutes , Cytophagales , and OP11 , we identified many rRNA genes from the BAC library affiliated with the bacterial division Acidobacterium ; all of these sequences were affiliated with subdivisions that lack cultured representatives. The complete sequence of one BAC clone derived from a member of the Acidobacterium division revealed a complete rRNA operon and 20 other open reading frames, including predicted gene products involved in cell division, cell cycling, folic acid biosynthesis, substrate metabolism, amino acid uptake, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. This study is the first step in using genomics to reveal the physiology of as-yet-uncultured members of the Acidobacterium division.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Who are the Lebanese?,census; who,1999.0,10.1080/13530199908705684,"Abstract The Lebanese state is analysed as a membership organization where both formal‐legal and political objectives control admission. The 1932 census played a fundamental role in the state‐building process of the Lebanese state: political representation was based on its findings, it was the basis for personal registration of the population residing on Lebanese territories, and it formed one of the cornerstones for obtaining citizenship in the Lebanese state. This article shows that the way the census figures were presented and analysed embodies issues of contest regarding the identity of the Lebanese state and who its members should be. The restrictive citizenship policy practised by the Maronite‐dominated regime until the outbreak of the civil war in 1975 is understood as a means to sustain political domination in an ethnically divided society. Lebanon provides an example of the political sensitivity of demographic figures in polities where fixed proportional representation constitutes the main principle of representative political organization.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

This suggests that the level of urbanization was 36.09 per cent. Whereas this is a reasonable figure that appears to fit well the general rising trend of urbanization shown in the previous four censuses, the levels of urbanization reported in the five censuses are not really comparable because the criteria used to enumerate “urban” population have been different for different censuses. Before the State Statistical Bureau produces a set of comparable figures on the levels of China's urbanization based on a set of uniform criteria, the problem of data incomparability concerning the levels of urbanization will continue to baffle users. This report analyses the statistical criteria defining China's urban population used in the 2000 census, compares them with the criteria of the previous censuses and presents two sets of adjusted and internally coherent time-series data to remedy the problem of data incomparability.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

This census interval effect could be confounding or perhaps even driving conclusions from comparative studies involving such rate estimates. We quantify this artefact for tropical forest trees, develop correction methods and re‐assess some previously published conclusions about forest dynamics. Mortality rates of &gt; 50 species at each of seven sites in Africa, Latin America, Asia and Australia were used as subpopulations to simulate stand‐level mortality rates in a heterogeneous population when census intervals varied: all sites showed decreasing stand mortality rates with increasing census interval length. Stand‐level mortality rates from 14 multicensus long‐term forest plots from Africa, Latin America, Asia and Australia also showed that, on average, mortality rates decreased with increasing census interval length. Mortality, recruitment or turnover rates with differing census interval lengths can be compared using the mean rate of decline from the 14 long‐term plots to standardize estimates to a common census length using λ corr = λ × t 0.08 , where λ is the rate and t is time between censuses in years. This simple general correction should reduce the bias associated with census interval variation, where it is unavoidable. Re‐analysis of published results shows that the pan‐tropical increase in stem turnover rates over the late 20th century cannot be attributed to combining data with differing census intervals. In addition, after correction, Old World tropical forests do not have significantly lower turnover rates than New World sites, as previously reported. Our pan‐tropical best estimate adjusted stem turnover rate is 1.81 ± 0.16% a −1 (mean ± 95% CI, n = 65). As differing census intervals affect comparisons of mortality, recruitment and turnover rates, and can lead to erroneous conclusions, standardized field methods, the calculation of local correction factors at sites where adequate data are available, or the use of our general standardizing formula to take account of sample intervals, are to be recommended.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,
,Who counts?: the politics of census-taking in contemporary America,Wisconsin,,,Who counts?: the politics of census-taking in contemporary America,politics; census; america,2000.0,10.5860/choice.37-4794,This article describes some of the legal decisions and problems among politicians and demographers who produce US census counts of population. The impact of the US Supreme Court hearing and decision in Wisconsin vs New York is discussed followed by an analysis of the Census Bureaus plans for the Census in 2000. Census procedures have been challenged since 1988. Litigation forced the use of the Post Enumeration Survey for adjusting the 1990 Census but the Census Director in 1991 issued a recommendation for not adjusting the 1990 counts that was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in April 1993. Oral arguments were heard in the aforementioned New York case on January 10 1996. New York argued for the implementation of dual system estimation due to undercounting errors that were probably influenced by actions of Republican Commerce officials during the 1980s that prevented improvements in census counting. It was charged that Census Bureau methods violated the intent of Article 1 Section 2 of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection. Lawsuits challenged the Bureau to develop methods that would reduce the undercount of minorities and the urban poor. Other arguments of the state of Oklahoma Wisconsin the federal government for the Secretary of Commerce and New York City are summarized. The Solicitor General of the US Drew Days argued that the true total population of the US was unknown and unknowable and that the Secretary of Commerce had the authority to make decisions about the census. The main issue before the court became who had the authority to decide not to adjust. All of the US Supreme Court judges voted on March 20 1996 in favor of unadjusted census counts. The issue of statistical adjustment methods as a violation of the Constitution was not decided. Plans for the census of 2000 include reducing costs and increasing accuracy through a three-stage count strategy.,group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

With business data, firm and establishment distributions are highly skewed, preventing release of public use microdata versions.

The selection criteria for the LBG samples are examined with 85 spectroscopically identified objects, and the completeness and contamination of the samples are estimated from Monte Carlo simulations based on a photometric-redshift catalog of the Hubble Deep Field-North. We find that these LBG samples are nearly rest-frame UV magnitude-limited samples, missing systematically only 10% of red high-z galaxies (in number), which are a dusty population with E(B - V) ≳ 0.4. We calculate luminosity functions (LFs) of the LBGs with the estimated completeness and contamination and find (1) that the number density of bright galaxies (M1700 < -22 ; corresponding to SFR ≳ 100 h M☉ yr-1 with extinction correction) decreases significantly from z = 4 to 5 and (2) that the faint-end slope of the LFs of LBGs may become steeper toward higher redshifts. We estimate the dust extinction of z ≃ 4 LBGs with M < M* (≃-21) from UV-continuum slopes and obtain E(B - V) = 0.15 ± 0.03 as the mean value. The dust extinction remains constant with apparent luminosity but increases with intrinsic (i.e., extinction-corrected) luminosity. We find no evolution in dust extinction between LBGs at z = 3 and 4. We investigate the evolution of UV-luminosity density by integrating the LFs of LBGs and find that the UV-luminosity density at 1700 Å, ρUV, does not significantly change from z = 3 to 5, i.e., ρUV(z = 4)/ρUV(z = 3) = 1.0 ± 0.2 and ρUV(z = 5)/ρUV(z = 3) = 0.8 ± 0.4; thus, the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density (with correction for dust extinction) remains constant within the error bars, or possibly has a slight decline, from z = 3 to 5. We estimate the stellar mass density from the cosmic SFR thus obtained and find that this stellar mass density is consistent with those derived directly from the stellar mass function at z = 0-1 but exceeds those at z ~ 3 by a factor of 3. We find that the ratio of the UV-luminosity density of Lyα emitters (LAEs) to that of LBGs is ≃60% at z ≃ 5, and thus about half of star formation probably occurs in LAEs at z ≃ 5. We obtain a constraint on the escape fraction of UV ionizing photons (i.e., UV continuum in 900 Å) produced by LBGs, fesc ≳ 0.13. This implies that the escape fraction of LBGs may be larger than that of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Our results indicate that the racial identification of biracial children with an Asian parent is to a large extent an arbitrary option within today's prevailing racial classification scheme.

This paper proposed an approach to linking three levels (macro, medium and micro) of land classifications with areal census data on hierarchical census boundaries. Specifically, a method of building the correlations between areal census dwelling data and residential densities classified by a remote sensing approach was demonstrated. First, a texture statistic (homogeneity) along with six Thematic Mapper (TM) bands (bands 1-5 and 7) was put together to classify residential density levels. The homogeneity slightly enhanced classification accuracy. Then, to test the correlations between census dwelling data and residential densities, a multiple linear regression was conducted. It was found that areal census dwelling data had higher correlations with areas of different residential densities than with the aggregated area of a whole residential area at an individual census zone level. Finally, the paper discussed that dis-aggregation of areal census data based on dwelling densities within the framework of remote sensing and GIS would be very useful for multidisciplinary studies, such as natural hazards risk assessment.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The aim of the census was to estimate the total numbers of both species and describe their distributions. The method was based on nest counts from line transects which allowed the calculation of population densities of all individuals except suckling infants. Fifteen types of habitat were recognized and defined in terms of their structural features. In the initial phase of the study we did transects in each habitat-type and computed mean densities for each species in each habitat-type. In the second phase of the study we estimated the sizes of gorilla and chimpanzee populations throughout the country by extrapolation from these population density values. We did transects in all areas of the country and conducted interviews to check the accuracy of the population totals obtained by extrapolation. Corrections were made to the extrapolated totals to take into account different levels of hunting pressure and other human activities found to modify ape population densities. Total populations of 34,764 gorillas and 64,173 chimpanzees were estimated. An error of ± 20% was associated with the estimated population totals, which allows the conclusion that Gabon contains 35,000 ± 7,000 gorillas and 64,000 ± 13,000 chimpanzees. The figure for gorillas is much larger than previous estimates. This seems to be because (1) gorillas occur in almost all types of forest and are not restricted to man-made secondary forest as had been though; and (2) the geographical distribution of gorillas in Gabon is wider than previously believed. Gabon's large areas of undisturbed primary forest offer exceptional potential for conservation, not only of gorillas and chimpanzees, but also of the intact tropical rain forest ecosystems which they inhabit.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

In so doing, the OMB authorities created what amounted to a racial cosmology that spread throughout American society, affecting public perceptions about the racial hierarchy of American society. In 1997, the OMB issued a revised version of this classification in which small changes may profoundly affect the way policymakers and the American public think about race. At the very least, these revisions present significant challenges to social scientists who study race and ethnicity.

Most known oncogenes and tumor suppressors target entry into the cell cycle and control the G 1 /S transition. However, tumor-associated alterations in spindle formation or chromosome segregation are also frequent and may result in chromosomal instability. In fact, a few centrosomal or mitotic proteins such as aurora A, polo-like kinase 1 and PTTG1 (securin) have been reported to act as oncogenes. Some spindle checkpoint regulators such as the BUB kinases or MAD2 protect cells from aberrant chromosome segregation and may therefore function as suppressors of malignant transformation. However, few cancer-associated mutations in these or other mitotic regulators have been described thus far and many of these molecules do not fit into the classical definition of 'oncogenes' or 'tumor suppressor genes'. In some cases, both over-expression and decreased expression of these genes result in mitotic arrest. Moreover, some mitotic regulators such as MAD2 are either up- or down-regulated depending on the tumor types and, in both cases, these alterations result in chromosomal imbalances and tumor development. Minor changes in protein levels that do not compromise cell viability might therefore be sufficient to dysregulate the mitotic cycle and induce genomic instability. Despite the limited knowledge on the molecular basis of these processes, the clinical success of mitotic poisons such as taxanes reinforces the interest in these molecules, their involvement in human cancer and the therapeutic opportunities to modulate their function in cancer treatment.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Support was defined as daily use of noninvasive, negative-pressure, or invasive/transtracheal ventilators. Subsequent matching of demographic data, including date of birth, zip code, and gender supported maximal census yield without duplications. Geographic information systems were used to create distribution maps and estimate distances between children with chronic mechanical ventilator needs and key resources.A total of 197 children were identified as requiring chronic mechanical respiratory support in Massachusetts in 2005, which was a nearly threefold increase in this population in the 15-year interval since the last census. Congenital or perinatal-acquired neurologic or neuromuscular disorders constituted the majority of primary diagnoses (n = 107 [54%]). Chronic lung disease attributed to prematurity represented only 7% of the sample.Children receiving chronic mechanical respiratory support are a growing population. The shift in underlying diagnoses from pulmonary disease to neurogenic respiratory insufficiency has implications for hospital and community-based providers from all disciplines in extending services to the home setting. Barriers encountered when performing this study, however, reflect an overall lack of coordination among the many individuals and agencies involved in their care. Coordinated and centralized care efforts require a clear and managed flow of information; census reports such as this one are only the beginning. Direct needs assessments and quality-of-life surveys from families are needed to design and implement programmatic changes and advocacy efforts.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Using the TreePM+SPH GADGET-3 code, we carried out one set of non-radiative simulations, and two sets of simulations including radiative cooling, star formation and feedback from supernovae (SN), one of which also accounting for the effect of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). The analysis is carried out with the twofold aim of studying the implication of stellar and hot gas content on the relative role played by SN and AGN feedback, and to calibrate the cluster baryon fraction and its evolution as a cosmological tool. We find that both radiative simulation sets predict a trend of stellar mass fraction with cluster mass that tends to be weaker than the observed one. However this tension depends on the particular set of observational data considered. Including the effect of AGN feedback alleviates this tension on the stellar mass and predicts values of the hot gas mass fraction and total baryon fraction to be in closer agreement with observational results. We further compute the ratio between the cluster baryon content and the cosmic baryon fraction, Y_b, as a function of cluster-centric radius and redshift. At R_500 we find for massive clusters with M_500>2\times10^{14} h^{-1} M_sun that Y_b is nearly independent of the physical processes included and characterized by a negligible redshift evolution: Y_{b,500}=0.85+/-0.03 with the error accounting for the intrinsic r.m.s. scatter within the set of simulated clusters. At smaller radii, R_2500, the typical value of Y_b slightly decreases, by an amount that depends on the physics included in the simulations, while its scatter increases by about a factor of two.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Our analyses are based on the detection of the high-excitation emission line [Ne v]λ14.32 μm (97.1 eV) to unambiguously identify AGN activity. We find that 17 of the 64 infrared (IR) bright galaxies in our sample host AGN activity (≈27+8−6 per cent), ?50 per cent of which are not identified as AGN using optical spectroscopy. The large AGN fraction indicates a tighter connection between AGN activity and IR luminosity for galaxies in the local Universe than previously found, potentially indicating a close association between AGN activity and star formation. The optically unidentified AGN span a wide range of galaxy type (S0–Ir) and are typically starburst-dominated systems hosting modest-luminosity AGN activity (L[Ne V]≈ 1037–1039 erg s−1). The non-identification of optical AGN signatures in the majority of these galaxies appears to be due to extinction towards the AGN, rather than intrinsically low-luminosity AGN activity; however, we note that the AGN optical signatures are diluted in some galaxies due to strong star formation activity. Examination of optical images shows that the optically unidentified AGN with evidence for extinction are hosted in either highly inclined galaxies or galaxies with dust lanes, indicating that obscuration of the AGN is not necessarily due to an obscuring torus. We therefore conclude that optical spectroscopic surveys miss approximately half of the AGN population simply due to extinction through the host galaxy.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Methods to census lianas and estimate biomass, however, differ among studies, possibly hindering attempts to compare liana communities. At Nouragues Research Station (French Guiana), we tested the extent to which liana abundance, basal area, and estimated biomass differed depending on stem diameter measurement location, inclusion of ramets, inclusion of lianas rooted within versus passing through the plot, and plot shape. We found that the mean per plot abundance and basal area of lianas were significantly greater when lianas were measured low on the stem, when ramets were included, and when lianas were sampled in transects (2 × 50 m) than in square plots (10 × 10 m). Mean per plot liana abundance and basal area were 21 percent and 58 percent greater, when stems were measured at the largest spot on the stem compared to 130 cm from the ground, respectively. Including liana ramets increased average per plot liana abundance, basal area, and estimated biomass by 19, 17, and 16 percent, respectively. To facilitate cross‐study comparisons, we developed conversion equations that equate liana abundance, diameter, and basal area based on the measurements taken at four different stem locations. We tested these equations at Lambir Hills National Park, Malaysia and found that they did not differ significantly between the two sites, suggesting that the equations may be broadly applicable. Finally, we present a new allometric equation relating diameter and biomass developed from 424 lianas from five independent data sets collected in four countries.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The overall density calculated for all transects was 0.4 nesting gorillas/km2. The highest density, 1.2 nesting gorillas/km2, was found in the vast Likouala swamp area of north central Congo. The two northern sites showed low densities of 0.1 and 0.2 nesting gorillas/km2, respectively. The northwestern site showed an intermediate density of 0.6 nesting gorillas/km2. The vegetation type with the highest density was swamp forest with 2.4 nesting gorillas/km2.

Over 600 encoded proteins have been identified, cataloged, and classified according to predicted function, subcellular location, and alternative splicing. At least one-third of these proteins were previously annotated as “unknown function” or with functions unrelated to acyl lipid metabolism; therefore, this study has improved the annotation of over 200 genes. In particular, annotation of the lipolytic enzyme group (at least 110 members total) has been improved by the critical examination of the biochemical literature and the sequences of the numerous proteins annotated as “lipases.” In addition, expressed sequence tag (EST) data have been surveyed, and more than 3,700 ESTs associated with the genes were cataloged. Statistical analysis of the number of ESTs associated with specific cDNA libraries has allowed calculation of probabilities of differential expression between different organs. More than 130 genes have been identified with a statistical probability &amp;gt; 0.95 of preferential expression in seed, leaf, root, or flower. All the data are available as a Web-based database, the Arabidopsis Lipid Gene database (http://www.plantbiology.msu.edu/lipids/genesurvey/index.htm).

The very same day, a group of leading ethnographers met at the Academy of Sciences in Petrograd to discuss a directive they had received from the Soviet of Nationalities: define nationality, determine “rational criteria” for classifying the population in the first All-Union Census, and notify the Central Statistical Administration as soon as possible. The legal formation of the Soviet Union had been completed, but the state-building process, which involved “re-imagining” the former Russian empire as a socialist federation of nationalities, was just getting under way. This essay argues that the classification of Soviet citizens by nationality in the All-Union Censuses of 1926, 1937, and 1939 was a fundamental component of the creation of the multinational state. The very establishment of the census category nationality marked a critical break with the tsarist regime, which had categorized its subjects on the basis of religion and native language. Ethnographers, statisticians, and linguists from Minsk to Vladivostok who formulated questionnaires and drew up lists of nationalities for all three censuses used their expertise to divine order out of chaos and create a new definitional grid.

The level of education is consistently reported as higher than it is (errors are not mean 0), errors in the reporting of education are correlated with covariates that appear in earnings regressions, and errors in the reporting of education appear correlated with the error term in a model of earnings determination. Thus, neither well-known results on classical measurement error nor recent models of nonclassical measurement error are likely valid when using Census and CPS data.

Historical tax data allowed us to track subjects’ residential postal code annually. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for each pollutant separately and adjusted for the other pollutants. We also estimated the product of the three HRs as a measure of the cumulative association with mortality for several causes of death for an increment of the mean minus the 5th percentile of each pollutant: 5.0 μg/m3 for PM2.5, 9.5 ppb for O3, and 8.1 ppb for NO2.ResultsPM2.5, O3, and NO2 were associated with nonaccidental and cause-specific mortality in single-pollutant models. Exposure to PM2.5 alone was not sufficient to fully characterize the toxicity of the atmospheric mix or to fully explain the risk of mortality associated with exposure to ambient pollution.

We pay particular attention to educational inequality based on gender and the household registration system (hukou) in the context of educational expansion. Results show a substantial increase in educational opportunities over time at all levels. In particular, women have gained relatively more; gender inequality has decreased over time, and the gap in college enrollments was even reversed to favor women in 2005. However, rural–urban inequality was enlarged in the 1990s. The educational expansion has mainly benefited females and urban residents.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Until recently, such categorization had largely escaped critical scrutiny, being viewed and treated as a technical procedure requiring little conceptual clarity or historical explanation. Recent political developments and methodological changes, in US censuses especially, have engendered a critical reexamination of both the comparative and the historical dimensions of categorization. The author presents a comparative analysis of the histories of racial/color categorization in American and Brazilian censuses and shows that racial (and color) categories have appeared in these censuses because of shifting ideas about race and the enduring power of these ideas as organizers of political, economic, and social life in both countries. These categories have not appeared simply as demographic markers. The author demonstrates that censuses are instruments at a state's disposal and are not simply detached registers of population and performance.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

This paper describes the epidemiological characteristics of heat‐related deaths among workers in the US 2000–2010. Methods Fatality data were obtained at the Bureau of Labor Statistics from the confidential on‐site Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries database. Fatality rates and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated by year, sex, age group, ethnicity, race, state, and industry. Results Between 2000 and 2010, 359 occupational heat‐related deaths were identified in the U.S., for a yearly average fatality rate of 0.22 per 1 million workers. Highest rates were found among Hispanics, men, the agriculture and construction industries, the state of Mississippi, and very small establishments. Conclusions This study provides the first comprehensive national profile of heat‐related deaths in the U.S. workplace.

The comparison is in the form of a census (or comprehensive accounting) of the relative occurrence of secondary and tertiary structures in the genomes, which particular emphasis on patterns of supersecondary structure. Comparison of secondary structure shows that the three genomes have nearly the same overall secondary-structure content, although they differ markedly in amino acid composition. Comparison of super-secondary structure, using a novel ""frequent-words"" approach, shows that yeast has a preponderance of consecutive strands (e.g. beta-beta-beta patterns), Haemophilus, consecutive helices (alpha-alpha-alpha), and Methanococcus, alternating helix-strand structures (beta-alpha-beta). Yeast also has significantly more helical membrane proteins than the other two genomes, with most of the differences concentrated in proteins containing two transmembrane segments. Comparison of tertiary structure (by sequence matching and domain-level clustering) highlights the substantial duplication in each genome (≈30% to 50%), with the degree of duplication following similar patterns in all three. Many sequence families are shared among the genomes, with the degree of overlap between any two genomes being roughly similar. In total, the three genomes contain 148 of the ≈300 known protein folds. Forty-five of these 148 that are present in all three genomes are especially enriched in mixed super-secondary structures (alpha/beta). Moreover, the five most common of these 45 (the ""top-5"") have a remarkably similar super-secondary structure architecture, containing a central sheet of parallel strands with helices packed onto at least one face and beta-alpha-beta connections between adjacent strands.

This growth is likely to have significant social, economic and environmental impacts, and make the achievement of international development goals more difficult. The measurement, monitoring and potential mitigation of these impacts require high resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions. In low income countries, however, where the changes will be concentrated, the least information on the distribution of population exists. In this paper we investigate whether satellite imagery in combination with land cover information and census data can be used to create inexpensive, high resolution and easily-updatable settlement and population distribution maps over large areas.We examine various approaches for the production of maps of the East African region (Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania) and where fine resolution census data exists, test the accuracies of map production approaches and existing population distribution products. The results show that combining high resolution census, settlement and land cover information is important in producing accurate population distribution maps.We find that this semi-automated population distribution mapping at unprecedented spatial resolution produces more accurate results than existing products and can be undertaken for as little as $0.01 per km(2).

The unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of survey selection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated, IR-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selection biases. We find that IR-luminous galaxies have SEDs with broad far-IR peaks characterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures in the 25-45K range. Hot (T>45K) SEDs and cold (T<25K), cirrus-dominated SEDs are rare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts such as M82 and cool spirals such as M51. We observe a luminosity-temperature (L-T) relation, where the average dust temperature of log[L_IR/L_sun]=12.5 galaxies is about 10K higher than that of their log[L_IR/L_sun]=10.5 counterparts. However, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is the driving factor behind the L-T relation, the increase in dust mass and/or starburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. Our results show that the dust conditions in IR-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time: at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10K lower than what is measured locally. This is manifested as a flattening of the L-T relation, suggesting that (U)LIRGs in the early Universe are typically characterised by a more extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalent sources. Interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminosity dependent, with the fraction of LIRGs with T<35K showing a 2-fold increase from z~0 to z~2, whereas that of ULIRGs with T<35K shows a 6-fold increase.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Furthermore, we found little evidence for habituation by murres to the UAV. Most gulls flew off in response to the UAV, but returned to the nest within five minutes. Counts of gull nests and adults were similar between UAV and ground photography, however the UAV detected up to 52.4% more chicks because chicks were camouflaged and invisible to ground observers.

A number of mathematical and statistical refinements to previously reported methods were explored. The robustness of these techniques as a practical methodology for population estimation was investigated and evaluated using a primary image for model development and training, and a second image for validation. Correlations of up to 0.92 in the training set and up to 0.86 in the validation set were obtained between census and remote sensing estimates of CD population density, with median proportional errors of 17.4% and 18.4%, respectively. Total urban populations were estimated with errors of +1% and-3%, respectively. These results indicate a moderate level of accuracy and a substantial degree of robustness. Accuracy was greatest in suburban areas of intermediate population density. There was a general tendency towards attenuation in all models tested, with high densities being under-estimated and low densities being over-estimated. It is concluded that the level of accuracy obtainable with this methodology is limited by heterogeneity within the individual CDs, particularly large rural CDs, and that further improvements are in principle unlikely using the aggregated approach.

In many countries this is usually accomplished using address range TIGER-type files in conjunction with geocoding packages within a GIS. Improvements in GIS functionality and the storage capacity of large databases mean that the spatial investigation of data at the individual address level is now commonly performed. This process relies on the accuracy of the geocoding mechanism and this paper examines this accuracy in relation to cadastral records and census tracts. Results from a study of over 20 000 addresses in Sydney, Australia, using a TIGER-type geocoding process suggest that 5-7.5% (depending on geocoding method) of addresses may be misallocated to census tracts, and more than 50% may be given coordinates within the land parcel of a different property.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

At the same time, it nearly eliminates the problem that the two-question format fostered of classifying many Hispanics as “some other race” while maintaining a similar number of Americans classified as Hispanic or Latino.

We also report observations for 13 of the 17 known Tuc–Hor members in this spectral type range, and that 62 additional candidates are likely to be unassociated field stars; the confirmation frequency for new candidates is therefore 129/191 = 67%. We have used radial velocities, Hα emission, and Li6708 absorption to distinguish between contaminants and bona fide members. Our expanded census of Tuc–Hor increases the known population by a factor of ∼3 in total and by a factor of ∼8 for members with SpT ⩾ K3, but even so, the K–M dwarf population of Tuc–Hor is still markedly incomplete. Our expanded census allows for a much more detailed study of Tuc–Hor than was previously feasible. The spatial distribution of members appears to trace a two-dimensional sheet, with a broad distribution in X and Y, but a very narrow distribution (±5 pc) in Z. The corresponding velocity distribution is very small, with a scatter of ±1.1 km s−1 about the mean UVW velocity for stars spanning the entire 50 pc extent of Tuc–Hor. We also show that the isochronal age (τ ∼ 20–30 Myr) and the lithium depletion boundary age (τ ∼ 40 Myr) disagree, following the trend in other pre-main-sequence populations for isochrones to yield systematically younger ages. The Hα emission line strength follows a trend of increasing equivalent width with later spectral type, as is seen for young clusters. We find that moving group members have been depleted of measurable lithium for spectral types of K7.0–M4.5. None of our targets have significant infrared excesses in the WISE W3 band, yielding an upper limit on warm debris disks of F < 0.7%. Finally, our purely kinematic and color–magnitude selection procedure allows us to test the efficiency and completeness for activity-based selection of young stars. We find that 60% of K–M dwarfs in Tuc–Hor do not have ROSAT counterparts and would have been omitted in X-ray-selected samples. In contrast, GALEX UV-selected samples using a previously suggested criterion for youth achieve completeness of 77% and purity of 78%, and we suggest new SpT-dependent selection criteria that will yield >95% completeness for τ ∼ 40 Myr populations with GALEX data available.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The raw source data is usually considered to be confidential.

Traditional disclosure protection techniques result in official data products that do not fully utilize the information content of the underlying microdata. Typically, these products take the form of simple aggregate tabulations. In a few cases anonymized public-use micro samples are made available, but these face a growing risk of re-identification by the increasing amounts of information about individuals and firms available in the public domain. One approach for overcoming these risks is to release products based on synthetic data where values are simulated from statistical models designed to mimic the (joint) distributions of the underlying microdata. We discuss recent Census Bureau work to develop and deploy such products.

It uses the cross tabulations of ethnicity by religion to back-project the growth of the Muslim population from 21,000 in 1951 to 1.6 millions in 2001. It examines the social, economic, demographic and geographic characteristics of the population. Although Muslims are often represented as a homogenous group, there are considerable internal differences, so that the characteristics of the population as a whole do not apply to all groups within. The 2001 Census shows that two-thirds of British Muslims are ethnically Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi, but one-third comes from diverse European, African, North African, Middle Eastern and other Asian sources. Nevertheless, Muslim gender roles emerge as a critical differentiator of socio-economic vulnerability. Taken as a whole, the Muslim population is young and rapidly growing; its socio-economic profile is depressed, marked by the exceptionally low participation rate of women in the formal labour market, and by high concentration in areas of multiple deprivation.

We use the Key Statistics for local authorities from the 2001 Census, released on 13 February 2003 by the census authorities. All of the variables from the 26 Key Statistics tables which can be compared over time with the 1991 Census are examined. The analysis is then extended for a subset of variables that were similarly measured in 1971 and 1981. We conclude that for key aspects of life in Britain, as recorded by the censuses, the nation has continued in the 1990s to divide socially geographically, often at a faster rate than was occurring in the 1980s or 1970s. Where there appears to have been a reduction in polarisation it tends to have been for those aspects of life which are now poorly measured by the census. The paper concludes with speculation about the possible reasons for the continued division of the country into areas now more easily than ever typified as being old and young, settled and migrant, black and white, or rich and poor. Finally the potential for the continued sociospatial polarisation of Britain is discussed. The paper begins with a fictional vignette.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The targets are taken both from our own cross-referencing of the NLTT Catalogue and the 2MASS Second Incremental Data Release, and from the revised NLTT compiled recently by Salim & Gould. All are identified as nearby-star candidates based on their location in the (mr, mr-Ks) diagram. Three hundred stars discussed here have previous astrometric, photometric, or spectroscopic observations. We present new BVRI photometry for 101 stars, together with low-resolution spectroscopy of a further 400 dwarfs. In total, we find that 241 stars are within 20 pc of the Sun, while a further 70 lie within 1 σ of our distance limit. Combining the present results with previous analyses, we have quantitative observations for 1910 of the 1913 candidates in our NLTT nearby-star samples. Eight hundred fifteen of those stars have distance estimates of 20 pc or less, including 312 additions to the local census. With our NLTT follow-up observations essentially complete, we have searched the literature for K and early-type M dwarfs within the sampling volume covered by the 2MASS second release. Comparing the resultant 20 pc census against predicted numbers, derived from the 8 pc luminosity function, shows an overall deficit of ∼20% for stellar systems and ∼35% for individual stars. Almost all are likely to be fainter than MJ = 7, and at least half are probably as yet undiscovered companions of known nearby stars. Our results suggest that there are relatively few missing systems at the lowest luminosities, MJ > 8.5. We discuss possible means of identifying the missing stars.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

However, given the risk of revealing individual information, many statistical agencies are considering disclosure control methods based on differential privacy, which add noise to tabulated data. Unlike other applications of differential privacy, however, census statistics must be postprocessed after noise injection to be usable. We study the impact of the U.S. Census Bureau’s latest disclosure avoidance system (DAS) on a major application of census statistics, the redrawing of electoral districts. We find that the DAS systematically undercounts the population in mixed-race and mixed-partisan precincts, yielding unpredictable racial and partisan biases. While the DAS leads to a likely violation of the “One Person, One Vote” standard as currently interpreted, it does not prevent accurate predictions of an individual’s race and ethnicity. Our findings underscore the difficulty of balancing accuracy and respondent privacy in the Census.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Here we present a framework for estimating populations from the bottom up, entirely independently of national census data, a critical need in areas without recent and reliable census data. To make observations of population density, we replace national census data with a microcensus, in which we enumerate population for a sample of small areas within the states of Kano and Kaduna in northern Nigeria. Using supervised texture-based classifiers with very high resolution satellite imagery, we produce a binary map of human settlement at 8-meter resolution across the two states and then a more refined classification consisting of 7 residential types and 1 non-residential type. Using the residential types and a model linking them to the population density observations, we produce population estimates across the two states in a gridded raster format, at approximately 90-meter resolution. We also demonstrate a simulation framework for capturing uncertainty and presenting estimates as prediction intervals for any region of interest of any size and composition within the study region. Used in concert with previously published demographic estimates, our population estimates allowed for predictions of the population under 5 in ten administrative wards that fit strongly with reference data collected during polio vaccination campaigns.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Our sample consists of 3553 stars with 54883 spectra in total comprising 3200 main-sequence stars up to 4 magnitudes below the turn-off. Each star in our sample has between 3 and 63 (with a median of 14) reliable radial velocity (RV) measurements within five years of observations. We introduce a statistical method to determine the probability of a star showing RV variations based on the whole inhomogeneous RV sample. Using HST photometry and an advanced dynamical MOCCA simulation of this specific GC we overcome observational biases that previous spectroscopic studies had to deal with. This allows us to infer a binary frequency in the MUSE FoV and enables us to deduce the underlying true binary frequency of (6.75+-0.72) % in NGC 3201. The comparison of the MUSE observations with the MOCCA simulation suggests a significant fraction of primordial binaries. We can also confirm a radial increase of the binary fraction towards the GC centre due to mass segregation. We discovered that in our sample at least (57.5+-7.9) % of blue straggler stars (BSS) are in a binary system. For the first time in a study of GCs, we were able to fit Keplerian orbits to a significant sample of 95 binaries. We present the binary system properties of eleven BSS and show evidence that two BSS formation scenarios, the mass transfer in binary (or triple) star systems and the coalescence due to binary-binary interactions, are present in our data. We also describe the binary and spectroscopic properties of four sub-subgiant (or red straggler) stars. Furthermore, we discovered two new black hole (BH) candidates with minimum masses (Msini) of (7.68+-0.50) M_sun, (4.4+-2.8) M_sun, and refine the minimum mass estimate on the already published BH to (4.53+-0.21) M_sun.

In the absence of a day-specific direct population count any indirect surrogate model to estimate population size lacks a standard to assess associated uncertainties. Therefore, the objective of this study was to collect wastewater samples at a unique opportunity, that is, on a census day, as a basis for a model to estimate the number of people contributing to a given wastewater sample. Mass loads for a wide range of pharmaceuticals and personal care products were quantified in influents of ten sewage treatment plants (STP) serving populations ranging from approximately 3500 to 500 000 people. Separate linear models for population size were estimated with the mass loads of the different chemical as the explanatory variable: 14 chemicals showed good, linear relationships, with highest correlations for acesulfame and gabapentin. De facto population was then estimated through Bayesian inference, by updating the population size provided by STP staff (prior knowledge) with measured chemical mass loads. Cross validation showed that large populations can be estimated fairly accurately with a few chemical mass loads quantified from 24-h composite samples. In contrast, the prior knowledge for small population sizes cannot be improved substantially despite the information of multiple chemical mass loads. In the future, observations other than chemical mass loads may improve this deficit, since Bayesian inference allows including any kind of information relating to population size.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Such 'scale-appropriate' machinery can increase returns to land and labour, although the still substantial capital investment required can preclude smallholder ownership. Increasing machinery demand has resulted in relatively well-developed markets for rental services for tillage, irrigation, and post-harvest operations. Many smallholders thereby access agricultural machinery that may have otherwise been cost prohibitive to purchase through fee-for-service arrangements, though opportunity for expansion remains. To more effectively facilitate the development and investment in scale-appropriate machinery, there is a need to better understand the factors associated with agricultural machinery purchases and service provision. This paper first reviews Bangladesh's historical policy environment that facilitated the development of agricultural machinery markets. It then uses recent Bangladesh census data from 814,058 farm households to identify variables associated with the adoption of the most common smallholder agricultural machinery - irrigation pumps, threshers, and power tillers (mainly driven by two-wheel tractors). Multinomial probit model results indicate that machinery ownership is positively associated with household assets, credit availability, electrification, and road density. These findings suggest that donors and policy makers should focus not only on short-term projects to boost machinery adoption. Rather, sustained emphasis on improving physical and civil infrastructure and services, as well as assuring credit availability, is also necessary to create an enabling environment in which the adoption of scale-appropriate farm machinery is most likely.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

A four-stage model of modern census geography development is presented. In the context of this model, current practice is reviewed, and new opportunities for automated census geography design presented, culminating in a current prototype for the separation of purpose-designed data collection and output geographies. The narrative is presented primarily from a British perspective, but focuses on internationally relevant issues such as the implementation of census geography design, and the influence of census output geography on data analysis.""",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

In recent decades, the quantity of historical census record linkage has exploded, owing largely to the advent of new machine-readable data created by genealogical organizations. Investigators are examining economic and geographic mobility across multiple generations and also engaging many new topics. Several analysts are exploring the effects of early-life socioeconomic conditions, environmental exposures, or natural disasters on family, health, and economic outcomes in later life. Other studies exploit natural experiments to gauge the impact of policy interventions such as social welfare programs and educational reforms. The new data sources have led to a proliferation of record linkage methodologies, and some widespread approaches inadvertently introduce errors that can lead to false inferences. A new generation of large-scale shared data infrastructure now in preparation will ameliorate weaknesses of current linkage methods.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We have also detected three MSPs out of nine observed in the frequency range 38-77 MHz. This is the largest sample of MSPs ever observed at these low frequencies, and half of the detected MSPs were observed for the first time at frequencies below 200 MHz. We present the average pulse profiles of the detected MSPs, their effective pulse widths, and flux densities and compare these with higher observing frequencies. The flux-calibrated, multifrequency LOFAR pulse profiles are publicly available via the EPN Database of Pulsar Profiles. We also present average values of dispersion measures (DM) and discuss DM and profile variations. About 35% of the MSPs show strong narrow profiles, another 25% exhibit scattered profiles, and the rest are only weakly detected. A qualitative comparison of LOFAR profiles with those at higher radio frequencies shows constant separation between profile components. Similarly, the profile widths are consistent with those observed at higher frequencies, unless scattering dominates at the lowest frequencies. This is very different from what is observed for normal pulsars and suggests a compact emission region in the MSP magnetosphere. The amplitude ratio of the profile components, on the other hand, can dramatically change towards low frequencies, often with the trailing component becoming dominant. As previously demonstrated this can be caused by aberration and retardation. This data set enables high-precision studies of pulse profile evolution with frequency, dispersion, Faraday rotation, and scattering in the interstellar medium. Characterising and correcting these systematic effects may improve pulsar-timing precision at higher observing frequencies, where pulsar timing array projects aim to directly detect gravitational waves.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Both of these aspects require expert knowledge, but with increasing number of records involved in such syntheses, the application of expert knowledge via manual curation is not feasible. Here we present a synthesis of planktonic foraminifera census counts in surface sediment samples, which is taxonomically harmonised, dereplicated and treated for numerical and other inconsistencies. The data treatment is implemented as an objective and largely automated pipeline, allowing us to reduce the initial 6,984 records to 4,205 counts from unique sites and informative technical or true replicates.

In total, five distinct fields were mapped covering 9 sq. degrees in five mid-IR bands spanning 3-24 microns. The survey includes the Orion Nebula Cluster, the Lynds 1641, 1630 and 1622 dark clouds, and the NGC 2023, 2024, 2068 and 2071 nebulae. These data are merged with the 2MASS point source catalog to generate a catalog of eight band photometry. We identify 3479 dusty young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion molecular clouds by searching for point sources with mid-IR colors indicative of reprocessed light from dusty disks or infalling envelopes. The YSOs are subsequently classified on the basis of their mid-IR colors and their spatial distributions are presented. We classify 2991 of the YSOs as pre-main sequence stars with disks and 488 as likely protostars. Most of the sources were observed with IRAC in 2-3 epochs over 6 months; we search for variability between the epochs by looking for correlated variability in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands. We find that 50% of the dusty YSOs show variability. The variations are typically small (0.2 mag.) with the protostars showing a higher incidence of variability and larger variations. The observed correlations between the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 micron variability suggests that we are observing variations in the heating of the inner disk due to changes in the accretion luminosity or rotating accretion hot spots.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Traditional disclosure protection techniques result in official data products that do not fully utilize the information content of the underlying microdata. Typically, these products take the form of simple aggregate tabulations. In a few cases anonymized public-use micro samples are made available, but these face a growing risk of re-identification by the increasing amounts of information about individuals and firms available in the public domain. One approach for overcoming these risks is to release products based on synthetic data where values are simulated from statistical models designed to mimic the (joint) distributions of the underlying microdata.

When designing your study, a key issue is whether your study objectives genuinely demand an absolute estimate of the population density from either a census (a total count) or a survey (in which density is estimated from statistically valid samples), or whether less information will suffice. Relative estimates of density using data from methods such as 'catch per unit effort' from trapping or systematic searching do not provide absolute densities but, as long as the sampling methods and other conditions are standardized, can allow reliable comparisons between locations and monitoring of population change over time. Population indices are based on indirect indicators that can be correlated with population density, such as the density of faeces or other characteristic signs.

In this study, we report a comprehensive, cultivation-independent census of microbial communities in 37 samples collected from these geothermal fields, encompassing sites ranging in temperature from 55.1 to 93.6°C, in pH from 2.5 to 9.4, and in mineralogy from silicates in Rehai to carbonates in Ruidian. Richness was low in all samples, with 21–123 species-level OTUs detected. The bacterial phylum Aquificae or archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota were dominant in Rehai samples, yet the dominant taxa within those phyla depended on temperature, pH, and geochemistry. Rehai springs with low pH (2.5–2.6), high temperature (85.1–89.1°C), and high sulfur contents favored the crenarchaeal order Sulfolobales, whereas those with low pH (2.6–4.8) and cooler temperature (55.1–64.5°C) favored the Aquificae genus Hydrogenobaculum. Rehai springs with neutral-alkaline pH (7.2–9.4) and high temperature (>80°C) with high concentrations of silica and salt ions (Na, K, and Cl) favored the Aquificae genus Hydrogenobacter and crenarchaeal orders Desulfurococcales and Thermoproteales. Desulfurococcales and Thermoproteales became predominant in springs with pH much higher than the optimum and even the maximum pH known for these orders. Ruidian water samples harbored a single Aquificae genus Hydrogenobacter, whereas microbial communities in Ruidian sediment samples were more diverse at the phylum level and distinctly different from those in Rehai and Ruidian water samples, with a higher abundance of uncultivated lineages, close relatives of the ammonia-oxidizing archaeon ""Candidatus Nitrosocaldus yellowstonii"", and candidate division O1aA90 and OP1.

Furthermore, it remains debated whether mutated lncRNAs can drive tumorigenesis, and whether such functions could be conserved during evolution. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, we introduce the Cancer LncRNA Census (CLC), a compilation of 122 GENCODE lncRNAs with causal roles in cancer phenotypes. In contrast to existing databases, CLC requires strong functional or genetic evidence. CLC genes are enriched amongst driver genes predicted from somatic mutations, and display characteristic genomic features. Strikingly, CLC genes are enriched for driver mutations from unbiased, genome-wide transposon-mutagenesis screens in mice. We identified 10 tumour-causing mutations in orthologues of 8 lncRNAs, including LINC-PINT and NEAT1 , but not MALAT1 . Thus CLC represents a dataset of high-confidence cancer lncRNAs.

This project represents the most extensive application of multiple imputation to date, and the modeling effort was considerable as well—hundreds of logistic regressions were estimated. One goal of this article is to summarize the strategies used in the project so that researchers can better understand how the new data bases were created. Another goal is to show how modifications of maximum likelihood methods were made for the modeling and imputation phases of the project. To multiply-impute 1980 census-comparable codes for industries and occupations in two 1970 census public-use samples, logistic regression models were estimated with flattening constants. For many of the regression models considered, the data were too sparse to support conventional maximum likelihood analysis, so some alternative had to be employed. These methods solve existence and related computational problems often encountered with maximum likelihood methods. Inferences pertaining to effects of predictor variables and inferences regarding predictions from logit models are also more satisfactory. The Bayesian strategy used in this project can be applied in other sparse-data settings where logistic regression is used because the approach can be implemented easily with any standard computer program for logit regression or log-linear analysis.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We use the JHKL colors to obtain a census of infrared excess stars in the cluster. Of (391) stars brighter than 12th magnitude in the K and L bands, 80% ± 7% are found to exhibit detectable infrared excess on the J-H, K-L color-color diagram. Examination of a subsample of 285 of these stars with published spectral types yields a slightly higher infrared excess fraction of 85%. We find that 97% of the optical proplyds in the cluster exhibit excess in the JHKL color-color diagram indicating that the most likely origin of the observed infrared excesses is from circumstellar disks. We interpret these results to indicate that the fraction of stars in the cluster with circumstellar disks is between 80%–85%, confirming earlier published suggestions of a high disk fraction for this young cluster. Moreover, we find that the probability of finding an infrared excess around a star is independent of stellar mass over essentially the entire range of the stellar mass function down to the hydrogen burning limit. Consequently, the vast majority of stars in the Trapezium cluster appear to have been born with circumstellar disks and the potential to subsequently form planetary systems, despite formation within the environment of a rich and dense stellar cluster. We identify 78 stars in our sample characterized by K-L colors suggestive of deeply embedded objects. The spatial distribution of these objects differs from that of the rest of the cluster members and is similar to that of the dense molecular cloud ridge behind the cluster. About half of these objects are detected in the short wavelength (J and H) bands, and these are found to be characterized by extreme infrared excess. This suggests that many of these sources could be protostellar in nature. If even a modest fraction (i.e., ∼50%) of these objects are protostars, then star formation could be continuing in the molecular ridge at a rate comparable to that which produced the foreground Trapezium cluster.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

There is continuing scientific and public debate surrounding the fate of wildlife that remained in the abandoned area. Several previous studies of the Chernobyl exclusion zone (e.g. [2,3]) indicated major radiation effects and pronounced reductions in wildlife populations at dose rates well below those thought [4,5] to cause significant impacts. In contrast, our long-term empirical data showed no evidence of a negative influence of radiation on mammal abundance. Relative abundances of elk, roe deer, red deer and wild boar within the Chernobyl exclusion zone are similar to those in four (uncontaminated) nature reserves in the region and wolf abundance is more than 7 times higher. Additionally, our earlier helicopter survey data show rising trends in elk, roe deer and wild boar abundances from one to ten years post-accident.

Main outcome measures: Prevalence of medicines use, reasons for medicines use and sources of medicines. Results: Response rate was 37.3%. Medicines use was very common; 87.1% of participants took one or more medicines and 43.3% took five or more in the previous 24 hours. Complementary medicines were used by 46.3% of participants, 87.4% of whom used both conventional and complementary medicines. The most commonly used medicines were antihypertensive agents (43.2% of participants), natural marine and animal products including fish oil and glucosamine (32.4%) and lipid-lowering agents (30.4%). Doctors recommended 79.3% of all medicines and 93.0% of conventional medicines. Pharmacists commonly recommended occasional medicines (ie, as needed), while friends, family and media most often influenced use of complementary medicines. Conclusions: The use of multiple medicines is common and higher than reported in the 1995 National Health Survey. Today, much medicines use is to prevent future disease by influencing risk factors. High levels of polypharmacy highlight the need to support the safe and effective use of medicines in the community. Although doctors recommend or prescribe most medicines, self-directed medication use is common. This highlights the need for consumer access to accurate information and strategies to improve health literacy about medicines.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,
,The Census Bureau on Prospects for US Population Growth in the Twenty‐First Century,Washington,,,The Census Bureau on Prospects for US Population Growth in the Twenty‐First Century,census; bureau; prospects; us; population; growth; twenty; first; century,2000.0,10.1111/j.1728-4457.2000.00197.x,"The U.S. Census Bureau periodically releases projections of the US resident population, detailed by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. The most recent of these, issued 13 January 2000, for the first time extend to the year 2100 and also include information on the foreign‐bom population. (Earlier projections were carried up to 2080.) The extensive tabulations presenting the new set, and detailed explanation of the methodology and the assumptions underlying the projections, are accessible at the Census Bureau's web site: http://www.census.gov . A brief summary of some of the main results of these projections is reproduced below from United States Department of Commerce News , Washington, DC 20230. (The Census Bureau is an agency of the Department of Commerce.) Uncertainties as to future trends in fertility, mortality, and net migration over a period of some 100 years are very great, as is illustrated by the massive difference in the projected size of the population for 2100 in the three variants produced. The “middle” projected population figure of 571 million (which represents a growth of some 109 percent over its current level) is bracketed by “lowest” and “highest” alternative projections of 283 million and 1.18 billion, respectively. With somewhat lesser force, the point also applies to the 50‐year time span considered in the well‐known country‐by‐country projections of the United Nations. These projections are also detailed in three variants: low, middle, and high. The UN projections (last revised in 1998) envisage less rapid growth in the United States during the first part of the twenty‐first century than do the Census Bureau's. The projected population figures for 2050 in the three variants (low, middle, and high) are as follows (in millions): U.S. Census Bureau 313.5 403.7 552.8 United Nations 292.8 349.3 419.0 Since the initial age and sex distributions from which the two sets of population projections start are essentially identical, these differences reflect assumptions by the Census Bureau with respect to the three factors affecting population dynamics in the next 50 years. In the middle series, each of these assumptions is more growth‐producing in the Census Bureau's set than in that of the United Nations. Thus, in the middle of the twenty‐first century the Census Bureau anticipates male and female life expectancies of 81.2 and 86.7 years; the corresponding figures according to the UN are 78.8 and 84.4 years. Net immigration to the United States per 1000 population at midcentury is assumed to be 2.2 by the United Nations and somewhat above 2.4 according to the Census Bureau. The factor most affecting the difference between the projected population sizes, however, is the differing assumptions with respect to fertility. The middle UN series anticipates a midcentury US total fertility rate of 1.9 children per woman; the Census Bureau's assumption is slightly above 2.2. A notable feature of the Census Bureau's projection methodology in comparison to that of the UN is the recognition of differences in mortality and fertility, and also in immigration, with respect to race and Hispanic origin. Thus, at midcentury the white non‐Hispanic population is assumed to have a total fertility rate of 2.03; the corresponding figure for the population of Hispanic origin is 2.56. (Fertility in other population subgroups is expected to lie between these values, although closer to the fertility of non‐Hispanic whites.) And Hispanic immigration, currently the major component within total immigration, is assumed to remain significant throughout the next five decades (although by midcentury it is expected to be far exceeded by immigration of non‐Hispanic Asians). As a result, the structure of the US population by race and Hispanic origin is expected to shift markedly. To the extent that fertility and mortality differentials persist, such a shift also affects the mean fertility and mortality figures of the total population.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We approximate VGG anomalies over seamounts as sums of individual, partially overlapping, elliptical polynomial functions, which allows us to form a non-linear inverse problem by fitting the polynomial model to the observations. Model parameters for a potential seamount include geographical location, peak VGG amplitude, major and minor axes of the elliptical base, and the azimuth of the major axis. The non-linear inversion is very sensitive to the initial values for the location and amplitude; hence, they are constrained by the centre and amplitude of the uppermost contours obtained with a 1-Eötvös contour interval. With these initial conditions from contouring, we execute a step-wise and fully automated inversion and obtain optimal model estimates for potential seamounts; these are statistically evaluated for significance using the Akaike Information Criterion and F tests. A logarithmic barrier technique is applied to ensure positivity of all seamount amplitudes. After automatic and manual inspections of the model parameters we estimate actual heights and basal ellipses of the inspected potential seamounts directly from the predicted bathymetry grid. In this study, we find globally 24 643 potential seamounts (h ≥ 0.1 km) that are located away from continental margins; 8458 potential seamounts are taller than 1 km. Although our global estimate is significantly lower than predictions from previous studies, a first-order reconciliation of the size-frequency statistics obtained from those studies reveals that the previous counts are systematically overestimated. Because of the ambiguity of gravity signals due to small seamounts of h < 1 km and the overlap with abyssal hills, we estimate the global seamount census to lie in the 40 000–55 000 range. The seamount data from this study are accessible from http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/PT/SMTS.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We evaluated the capacity of a small UAS to census a large (>6,000 nests) coastal Common tern (Sterna hirundo) colony of which ground surveys are particularly disruptive and time-consuming. We compared aerial photographic tern counts to ground nest counts in 45 plots (5-m radius) throughout the colony at three intervals over a nine-day period in order to identify sources of variation and establish a coefficient to estimate nest numbers from UAS surveys. We also compared a full colony ground count to full counts from two UAS surveys conducted the following day. Finally, we compared colony disturbance levels over the course of UAS flights to matched control periods. Linear regressions between aerial and ground counts in plots had very strong correlations in all three comparison periods (R2 = 0.972-0.989, P < 0.001) and regression coefficients ranged from 0.928-0.977 terns/nest. Full colony aerial counts were 93.6% and 94.0%, respectively, of the ground count. Varying visibility of terns with ground cover, weather conditions and image quality, and changing nest attendance rates throughout incubation were likely sources of variation in aerial detection rates. Optimally timed UAS surveys of Common tern colonies following our method should yield population estimates in the 93-96% range of ground counts. Although the terns were initially disturbed by the UAS flying overhead, they rapidly habituated to it. Overall, we found no evidence of sustained disturbance to the colony by the UAS. We encourage colonial waterbird researchers and managers to consider taking advantage of this burgeoning technology.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

To do this, we characterize a large fraction of the currently known protein sequences ( approximately 140,000) in structural terms, by matching them to known structures via sequence comparison (or by secondary-structure class prediction for those without structural homologues). Overall, we find that an appreciable fraction of the known folds are present in each of the major groups of organisms (e.g., bacteria and eukaryotes share 156 of 275 folds), and most of the common folds are associated with many families of nonhomologous sequences (i.e., >10 sequence families for each common fold). However, different groups of organisms have characteristically distinct distributions of folds. So, for instance, some of the most common folds in vertebrates, such as globins or zinc fingers, are rare or absent in bacteria. Many of these differences in fold usage are biologically reasonable, such as the folds of metabolic enzymes being common in bacteria and those associated with extracellular transport and communication being common in animals. They also have important implications for database-based methods for fold recognition, suggesting that an unknown sequence from a plant is more likely to have a certain fold (e.g., a TIM barrel) than an unknown sequence from an animal.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Chemistry-based approaches to calculate NEC utilize the drawdown of seawater total alkalinity (TA) combined with residence time to calculate an instantaneous measurement of NEC. Census-based approaches combine annual growth rates with benthic cover and reef structural complexity to estimate NEC occurring over annual timescales. Here, NEC was calculated for Hog Reef in Bermuda using both chemistry and census-based NEC techniques to compare the mass-balance generated by the two methods and identify the dominant biocalcifiers at Hog Reef. Our findings indicate close agreement between the annual 2011 census-based NEC 2.35±1.01 kg CaCO3•m-2•y-1 and the chemistry-based NEC 2.23±1.02 kg CaCO3•m-2•y-1 at Hog Reef. An additional record of Hog Reef TA data calculated from an autonomous CO2 mooring measuring pCO2 and modeled pHtotal every 3-hours highlights the dynamic temporal variability in coral reef NEC. This ability for chemistry-based NEC techniques to capture higher frequency variability in coral reef NEC allows the mechanisms driving NEC variability to be explored and tested. Just four coral species, Diploria labyrinthiformis, Pseudodiploria strigosa, Millepora alcicornis, and Orbicella franksi, were identified by the census-based NEC as contributing to 94±19% of the total calcium carbonate production at Hog Reef suggesting these species should be highlighted for conservation to preserve current calcium carbonate production rates at Hog Reef. As coral cover continues to decline globally, the agreement between these NEC estimates suggest that either method, but ideally both methods, may serve as a useful tool for coral reef managers and conservation scientists to monitor the maintenance of coral reef structure and ecosystem services.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The census of open clusters in the Milky Way is in a never-before seen state of flux. Recent works have reported hundreds of new open clusters thanks to the incredible astrometric quality of the Gaia satellite, but other works have also reported that many open clusters discovered in the pre Gaia era may be associations. Aims. We aim to conduct a comparison of clustering algorithms used to detect open clusters, attempting to statistically quantify their strengths and weaknesses by deriving the sensitivity, specificity, and precision of each as well as their true positive rate against a larger sample. Methods. We selected DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, and Gaussian mixture models for further study, owing to their speed and appropriateness for use with Gaia data. We developed a preprocessing pipeline for Gaia data and developed the algorithms further for the specific application to open clusters. We derived detection rates for all 1385 open clusters in the fields in our study as well as more detailed performance statistics for 100 of these open clusters. Results. DBSCAN was sensitive to 50%–62% of the true positive open clusters in our sample, with generally very good specificity and precision. HDBSCAN traded precision for a higher sensitivity of up to 82%, especially across different distances and scales of open clusters. Gaussian mixture models were slow and only sensitive to 33% of open clusters in our sample, which tended to be larger objects. Additionally, we report on 41 new open cluster candidates detected by HDBSCAN, three of which are closer than 500 pc. Conclusions. When used with additional post-processing to mitigate its false positives, we have found that HDBSCAN is the most sensitive and effective algorithm for recovering open clusters in Gaia data. Our results suggest that many more new and already reported open clusters have yet to be detected in Gaia data.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

However, there is a dearth of information on the population-level implications of slum life for human health. This manuscript describes the 2005 Census and Mapping of Slums (CMS), which used geographic information systems (GIS) tools and digital satellite imagery combined with more traditional fieldwork methodologies, to obtain detailed, up-to-date and new information about slum life in all slums of six major cities in Bangladesh (including Dhaka). Results The CMS found that Bangladeshi slums are very diverse: there are wide intra- and inter-city variations in population size, density, the percent of urban populations living in slums, and sanitation conditions. Findings also show that common beliefs about slums may be outdated; of note , tenure insecurity was found to be an issue in only a small minority of slums. Conclusion The methodology used in the 2005 Bangladesh CMS provides a useful approach to mapping slums that could be applied to urban areas in other low income societies. This methodology may become an increasingly important analytic tool to inform policy, as cities in developing countries are forecasted to continue increasing their share of total global population in the coming years, with slum populations more than doubling in size during the same period.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Decreasing human impact in marginal rural areas often triggers a recovery of seminatural vegetation. Over a period of 25 years, we studied the changes in landscape and vegetation structure that followed land abandonment in a traditional Mediterranean mosaic of crops, grasslands, shrublands and woodlands, and assessed their effects on songbird occurrence and distribution. We combined an analysis of vegetation changes based on aerial photo interpretation with an analysis of bird censuses from 1978, 1992 and 2003 at two spatial scales: landscape and census plot (respectively 2800 and 3 ha). The perceived temporal changes in the vegetation were scale dependent. At the landscape scale, open habitats tended to disappear and woodlands matured. The contrasts in vegetation structure that defined habitat patches at the onset of the study tended to disappear. There was an overall shift of the bird community in favour of woodland species. At the scale of the census plot, however, the colonization by woody vegetation of patches formerly characterized by a homogeneous grass cover increased the local diversity of the vegetation, at least temporarily. Of seven species dependent on open habitats, the occurrence rate of five species significantly decreased, whereas it increased for two species: woodlark ( Lulula arborea ) and melodious warbler ( Hippolais polyglotta ). This increase was linked to the transitional increase in local vegetation diversity. In patches originally dominated by woodlands, local vegetation diversity decreased as woody vegetation expanded into clearings. The occurrence rate significantly increased for seven species relying on closed woodlands, while it decreased for two woodland species. As most species of high conservation profile in the Mediterranean are tied to open or to heterogeneous transitional habitats, these trends raise questions concerning their persistence in the future.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

To fill this gap in pollinator decline censuses and to provide a broad picture of the current status of honeybees across their natural range, we used microsatellite genetic markers to estimate colony densities and genetic diversity at different locations in Europe, Africa, and central Asia that had different patterns of land use. Genetic diversity and colony densities were highest in South Africa and lowest in Northern Europe and were correlated with mean annual temperature. Confounding factors not related to climate, however, are also likely to influence genetic diversity and colony densities in honeybee populations. Land use showed a significantly negative influence over genetic diversity and the density of honeybee colonies over all sampling locations. In Europe honeybees sampled in nature reserves had genetic diversity and colony densities similar to those sampled in agricultural landscapes, which suggests that the former are not wild but may have come from managed hives. Other results also support this idea: putative wild bees were rare in our European samples, and the mean estimated density of honeybee colonies on the continent closely resembled the reported mean number of managed hives. Current densities of European honeybee populations are in the same range as those found in the adverse climatic conditions of the Kalahari and Saharan deserts, which suggests that beekeeping activities do not compensate for the loss of wild colonies. Our findings highlight the importance of reconsidering the conservation status of honeybees in Europe and of regarding beekeeping not only as a profitable business for producing honey, but also as an essential component of biodiversity conservation.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

CloudSat snowfall observations and snowfall rate estimates from the CloudSat 2C-Snow Water Content and Snowfall Rate (2C-SNOW-PROFILE) product are partitioned between shallow cumuliform and nimbostratus cloud structures by utilizing coincident cloud category classifications from the CloudSat 2B-Cloud Scenario Classification (2B-CLDCLASS) product. Shallow cumuliform (nimbostratus) snowfall events comprise about 36% (59%) of snowfall events in the CloudSat snowfall dataset. The remaining 5% of snowfall events are distributed between other categories. Distinct oceanic versus continental trends exist between the two major snowfall categories, as shallow cumuliform snow-producing clouds occur predominantly over the oceans. Regional differences are also noted in the partitioned dataset, with over-ocean regions near Greenland, the far North Atlantic Ocean, the Barents Sea, the western Pacific Ocean, the southern Bering Sea, and the Southern Hemispheric pan-oceanic region containing distinct shallow snowfall occurrence maxima exceeding 60%. Certain Northern Hemispheric continental regions also experience frequent shallow cumuliform snowfall events (e.g., inland Russia), as well as some mountainous regions. CloudSat -generated snowfall rates are also partitioned between the two major snowfall categories to illustrate the importance of shallow snow-producing cloud structures to the average annual snowfall. While shallow cumuliform snowfall produces over 50% of the annual estimated surface snowfall flux regionally, about 18% (82%) of global snowfall is attributed to shallow (nimbostratus) snowfall. This foundational spaceborne snowfall study will be utilized for follow-on evaluative studies with independent model, reanalysis, and ground-based observational datasets to characterize respective dataset biases and to better quantify CloudSat snowfall detection and quantitative snowfall estimate uncertainties.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We report here IRAC/MIPS observations for 115 confirmed members and 41 photometric candidates of the ~10 Myr 25 Orionis aggregate in the OB1a subassociation, and 106 confirmed members and 65 photometric candidates of the 5 Myr region located in the OB1b subassociation. The 25 Orionis aggregate shows a disk frequency of 6% while the field in the OB1b subassociation shows a disk frequency of 13%. Combining IRAC, MIPS and 2MASS photometry we place stars bearing disks in several classes: stars with optically thick disks (class II systems), stars with an inner transitional disks (transitional disk candidates) and stars with ""evolved disks""; the last exhibit smaller IRAC/MIPS excesses than class II systems. In all, we identify 1 transitional disk candidate in the 25 Orionis aggregate and 3 in the OB1b field; this represents ~10% of the disk bearing stars, indicating that the transitional disk phase can be relatively fast. We find that the frequency of disks is a function of the stellar mass, suggesting a maximum around stars with spectral type M0. Comparing the infrared excess in the IRAC bands among several stellar groups we find that inner disk emission decays with stellar age, showing a correlation with the respective disk frequencies. The disk emission at the IRAC and MIPS bands in several stellar groups indicates that disk dissipation takes place faster in the inner region of the disks. Comparison with models of irradiated accretion disks, computed with several degrees of settling, suggests that the decrease in the overall accretion rate observed in young stellar groups is not sufficient to explain the weak disk emission observed in the IRAC bands for disk bearing stars with ages 5 Myr or older.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Observations of young stellar clusters with the Spitzer Space Telescope have amassed mid-infrared spectral energy distributions for thousands of star-disk systems from which transition disks can be identified. From a sample of 8 relatively nearby young regions (d <= 400 pc), we have identified about 20 such objects, which we term ""classical"" transition disks, spanning a wide range of stellar age and mass. We also identified two additional categories representing more ambiguous cases: ""warm excess"" objects with transition-like spectral energy distributions but moderate excess at 5.8 microns, and ""weak excess"" objects with smaller 24 micron excess that may be optically thin or exhibit advanced dust grain growth and settling. From existing Halpha emission measurements, we find evidence for different accretion activity among the three categories, with a majority of the classical and warm excess transition objects still accreting gas through their inner holes and onto the central stars, while a smaller fraction of the weak transition objects are accreting at detectable rates. We find a possible age dependence to the frequency of classical transition objects, with fractions relative to the total population of disks in a given region of a few percent at 1-2 Myr rising to 10-20% at 3-10 Myr. The trend is even stronger if the weak and warm excess objects are included. Classical transition disks appear to be less common, and weak transition disks more common, around lower-mass stars (M <= 0.3 Msun).",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

In any marine system, meiofauna play a key role in the functioning of the food webs and sustain important ecological processes. Estimates of meiofaunal biodiversity have been so far almost exclusively based on morphological analyses, but the very small size of these organisms and, in some cases, the insufficient morphological distinctive features limit considerably the census of the biodiversity of this component. Molecular approaches recently applied also to small invertebrates (including meiofauna) can offer a new momentum for the census of meiofaunal biodiversity. Here, we provide an overview on the application of metagenetic approaches based on the use of next generation sequencing platforms to study meiofaunal biodiversity, with a special focus on marine nematodes. Our overview shows that, although such approaches can represent a useful tool for the census of meiofaunal biodiversity, there are still different shortcomings and pitfalls that prevent their extensive use without the support of the classical taxonomic identification. Future investigations are needed to address these problems and to provide a good match between the contrasting findings emerging from classical taxonomic and molecular/bioinformatic tools.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Of the 10 methods tested, only three provided estimates sufficiently close to the actual for serious con- sideration. The two most promising methods were the belt transects of Kelker (1945) and Anderson and Pospahala (1970), both of which require a frequency distribution of perpendicular distances of the sighted objects from the census lines.

We compare the accuracy of underwater visual estimates of distance made by novice and experienced scientific divers and an underwater stereo-video system. We demonstrate the potential implications that distance errors may have on underwater visual census assessments of reef fish abundance. We also investigate how the accuracy and precision of scuba diver length estimates of fish is affected as distance increases. Distance was underestimated by both experienced (mean relative error = −11.7%, s.d. = 21.4%) and novice scientific divers (mean relative error = −5.0%, s.d. = 17.9%). For experienced scientific divers this error may potentially result in an 82% underestimate or 194% overestimate of the actual area censused, which will affect estimates of fish density. The stereo-video system also underestimated distance but to a much lesser degree (mean relative error = −0.9%, s.d. = 2.6%) and with less variability than the divers.

This figure is substantially higher than the proportion found by the British Social Attitudes survey and other national studies. Comparing the census with sample surveys and examining different parts of the UK raises two interesting questions. Why does the census produce a higher figure than recurrent surveys for nominal Christian identification? Why, when church attendance is higher in Scotland than in England and Wales, does the census show a higher proportion of nominal identifiers in the latter? It is argued that the answer to both questions is the same: anxiety about national identity.

It argues that because racial disparities in health and other social indicators persist undiminished, the continued assessment of race is essential. However, efforts must be made to ensure that racial data are of the highest quality. This will require uniform assessment of racial status that includes identifiers for subgroups of the Black population. Research also indicates that the health of multiracial persons varies by maternal race. Thus, efforts to monitor multiracial status should assess the race of both parents. More attention should also be given to analysis and interpretation of racial data and to the collection of additional data that capture characteristics linked to race (such as socioeconomic factors and racism) that may adversely affect health.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Bradshaw,The theta‐logistic is unreliable for modelling most census data,theta; census,2010.0,10.1111/j.2041-210x.2010.00029.x,"Summary 1. The theta‐logistic is a simple and flexible model for describing how the growth rate of a population slows as abundance increases. Starting at r m (taken as the maximum population growth rate), the growth response decreases in a convex or concave way (according to the shape parameter θ) to zero when the population reaches carrying capacity. 2. We demonstrate that fitting this model to census data is not robust and explain why. The parameters θ and r m are able to play‐off against each other (providing a constant product), thus allowing both to adopt extreme and ecologically implausible values. 3. We use simulated data to examine: (i) a population fluctuating around a constant carrying capacity ( K ); (ii) recovery of a population from 10% of carrying capacity; and (iii) a population subject to variation in K . We show that estimates of extinction risk depending on this or similar models are therefore prone to imprecision. We refute the claim that concave growth responses are shown to dominate in nature. 4. As the model can also be sensitive to temporal variation in carrying capacity, we argue that the assumption of a constant carrying capacity is both problematic and presents a fruitful direction for the development of phenomenological density‐feedback models.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

In combination with our dedicated algorithm for source deblending, MUSE provides unique multiplex capabilities in crowded stellar fields and allows us to acquire samples of up to 20 000 stars within the half-light radius of each cluster. The present paper focuses on the analysis of the internal dynamics of 22 out of the 25 clusters, using about 500 000 spectra of 200 000 individual stars. Thanks to the large stellar samples per cluster, we are able to perform a detailed analysis of the central rotation and dispersion fields using both radial profiles and two-dimensional maps. The velocity dispersion profiles we derive show a good general agreement with existing radial velocity studies but typically reach closer to the cluster centres. By comparison with proper motion data we derive or update the dynamical distance estimates to 14 clusters. Compared to previous dynamical distance estimates for 47 Tuc, our value is in much better agreement with other methods. We further find significant (>3sigma) rotation in the majority (13/22) of our clusters. Our analysis seems to confirm earlier findings of a link between rotation and the ellipticities of globular clusters. In addition, we find a correlation between the strengths of internal rotation and the relaxation times of the clusters, suggesting that the central rotation fields are relics of the cluster formation that are gradually dissipated via two-body relaxation.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of protected areas for increasing fish abundance or provided insight into the natural abundance and structure of reef fish communities in remote areas. Recently, high apex predator densities (>100,000 individuals·km−2) and biomasses (>4 tonnes·ha−1) have been reported for some remote islands suggesting the occurrence of inverted trophic biomass pyramids. However, few studies have critically evaluated the methods used for sampling conspicuous and highly mobile fish such as sharks. Ideally, UVC are done instantaneously, however, researchers often count animals that enter the survey area after the survey has started, thus performing non-instantaneous UVC. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a simulation model to evaluate counts obtained by divers deploying non-instantaneous belt-transect and stationary-point-count techniques. We assessed how fish speed and survey procedure (visibility, diver speed, survey time and dimensions) affect observed fish counts. Results indicate that the bias caused by fish speed alone is huge, while survey procedures had varying effects. Because the fastest fishes tend to be the largest, the bias would have significant implications on their biomass contribution. Therefore, caution is needed when describing abundance, biomass, and community structure based on non-instantaneous UVC, especially for highly mobile species such as sharks. Conclusions/Significance Based on our results, we urge that published literature state explicitly whether instantaneous counts were made and that survey procedures be accounted for when non-instantaneous counts are used. Using published density and biomass values of communities that include sharks we explore the effect of this bias and suggest that further investigation may be needed to determine pristine shark abundances and the existence of inverted biomass pyramids. Because such studies are used to make important management and conservation decisions, incorrect estimates of animal abundance and biomass have serious and significant implications.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Hollmann,Developing Official Stochastic Population Forecasts at the US Census Bureau,official; stochastic; population; forecasts; us; census; bureau,2004.0,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2004.tb00233.x,"Summary The U.S. Census Bureau is approaching a critical decision regarding a major facet of its methodology for forecasting the United States population. In the past, it has relied on alternative scenarios, low, medium, and high, to reflect varying interpretations of current trends in fertility, mortality, and international migration to forecast population. This approach has limitations that have been noted in the recent literature on population forecasting. Census Bureau researchers are embarking on an attempt to incorporate probabilistic reasoning to forecast prediction intervals around point forecasts to future dates. The current literature offers a choice of approaches to this problem. We are opting to employ formal time series modeling of parameters of fertility, mortality, and international migration, with stochastic renewal processes. The endeavor is complicated by the administrative necessity to produce a large amount of racial and Hispanic origin detail in the population, as well as the ubiquitous cross‐categories of age and sex. As official population forecasts must meet user demand, we are faced with the added challenge of presenting and supporting the resulting product in a way that is comprehensible to users, many of whom have little or no comprehension of the technical forecasting literature, and are accustomed to simple, deterministic answers. We may well find a need to modify our strategy, depending on the realities that may emerge from the limitations of data, the administrative requirements of the product, and the diverse needs of our user community.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Vision-based techniques have the advantage of being unobtrusive and hands are a natural device that can be used for more intuitive interfaces. But in order to use hands for interaction, it is necessary to be able to recognize them in images. In this paper, we propose to apply to the hand posture classification and recognition tasks an approach that has been successfully used for face detection (B. Froba and A. Ernst, 2004). The features are based on the modified census transform and are illumination invariant. For the classification and recognition processes, a simple linear classifier is trained, using a set of feature lookup-tables. The database used for the experiments is a benchmark database in the field of posture recognition. Two protocols have been defined. We provide results following these two protocols for both the classification and recognition tasks. Results are very encouraging",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Only one source was detected as a double nucleus. This result is compared with a cosmological merger rate model and interpreted in terms of (1) implications for post-merger time-scales for centralization of the two black holes, (2) implications for the possibility of 'stalled' systems and (3) the relationship of radio activity in nuclei to mergers. Our analysis suggests that binary pair evolution of supermassive black holes (both of masses ≥108 M⊙) spends less than 500 Myr in progression from the merging of galactic stellar cores to within the purported stalling radius for supermassive black hole pairs. The data show no evidence for an excess of stalled binary systems at small separations. We see circumstantial evidence that the relative state of radio emission between paired supermassive black holes is correlated within orbital separations of 2.5 kpc.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

OBJETIVO: Descrever resultados do censo de diálise da Sociedade Brasileira de Nefrologia referentes a 2011 e tendências observadas de 2000 a 2011. MÉTODOS: Levantamento utilizando questionário preenchido ""on-line"" pelas unidades de diálise do Brasil usando julho de 2011 como referência para estimativas. Do total de 643 unidades com programa dialítico crônico, 353 (54,9%) responderam. RESULTADOS: O número estimado de pacientes em diálise no Brasil em 2011 foi 91.314 (42.629 em 2000, 92.091 em 2010). Para aproximadamente 85% dos pacientes, o tratamento foi pago com recursos do SUS. As estimativas de prevalência e incidência para 2011 foram de 475 e 149 pacientes em diálise por milhão da população, respectivamente. Entre prevalentes, 90,6% estavam em hemodiálise, 31,5% tinham idade > 65 anos, 28% eram diabéticos, e 35,5% (n=32.454) estavam em fila de espera para transplante. Para 2011, o número estimado de pacientes iniciando diálise foi 28.680 (18.972 em 2010) e a taxa anual de mortalidade 19,9% (17,9% para 2010). CONCLUSÕES: Os dados indicam aumento pronunciado da população em diálise no Brasil ao longo dos anos, com tendência a estabilização nos dois últimos anos. As razões para aumento da incidência e mortalidade em 2011 merecem investigação. É grande o número estimado de pacientes em fila de espera para transplante renal.

In this paper, we proposed a high-performance hardware-friendly disparity estimation algorithm called mini-census adaptive support weight (MCADSW) and also proposed its corresponding real-time very large scale integration (VLSI) architecture. To make the proposed MCADSW algorithm hardware-friendly, we proposed simplification techniques such as using mini-census, removing proximity weight, using YUV color representation, using Manhattan color distance, and using scaled-and-truncate weight approximation. After applied these simplifications, the MCADSW algorithm was not only hardware-friendly, but was also 1.63 times faster. In the corresponding real-time VLSI architecture, we proposed partial column reuse and access reduction with expanded window to significantly reduce the bandwidth requirement. The proposed architecture was implemented using United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) 90 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology and can achieve a disparity estimation frame rate of 42 frames/s for common intermediate format size images when clocked at 95 MHz.

LeResche; Robert Rausch,Accuracy and Precision of Aerial Moose Censusing,accuracy; precision; aerial; moose; censusing,1974.0,10.2307/3800722,"Forty-nine observers flew 72 replicate counts over four fenced 1-square-mile (2.6 km'2) moose (Alces alces) enclosures. Under the most ideal conditions, experienced observers flying 15 minutes over each square mile in PA-18-150 aircraft saw only 68 percent of the moose present. Inexperienced observers saw 43 percent. Accuracy of counts was significantly affected by observer experience and currency, by number of observers, by snow conditions, by habitat and terrain, and by time of day. Moose density did not affect accuracy of counts at densities of seven or more per square mile. Counts were relatively precise within individual experienced observers (C.V. = 7-18 percent) and within some experience-current groups (C.V. = 8.5-9.9 percent). Experienced observers without current experience were both imprecise (C.V. = 24 percent) and inaccurate (46 percent). Aerial counts are not considered valid estimates of absolute moose numbers, but may be used as trend indicators in carefully controlled situations. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 38(2):175-182 Aerial censusing is presently the only practical way to estimate moose numbers in most of North America (Rausch and Bratlie 1965, Rausch and Bishop 1968, Bishop 1969, Bergerud and Manuel 1969). Determination of the extent to which such methods underestimate numbers has remained a problem when absolute numbers are sought. Benson (1966), Goddard (1966), and Bergerud (1968) have reviewed aerial censusing techniques and have suggested that substantial errors are inherent in most. Caughley and Goddard (1972) have suggested statistical methods for estimating these errors. Siniff and Skoog's (1964) random stratified, quadrat sampling method, modified for moose by Evans et al. (1966), made population estimations more plausible, but these techniques were still predicated on knowing what proportion of animals flown over were actually observed.

This article investigates how and why census racial classification policies changed during this period, only to stabilize abruptly before World War II. In the context of demographic transformations and their political consequences, we find that census policy in any given year was driven by a combination of scientific, political, and ideological motivations. Based on this analysis, we rethink existing theoretical approaches to censuses and racial classification, arguing that a nation's census is deeply implicated in and helps to construct its social and political order. Censuses provide the concepts, taxonomy, and substantive information by which a nation understands its component parts as well as the contours of the whole; censuses both create the image and provide the mirror of that image for a nation's self-reflection.

These studies are limited, however, by their exclusive focus on men, which ignores important gender differences in the wage gap, and by the inadequacy of the mean wage for characterizing the gap when, as in recent decades, the wage distribution dramatically changes. This study of recent immigrants examines changes across the entire wage distribution, for both genders. The authors find evidence, based partly on gender differences, that minimum wages strongly influenced the gap. A counterfactual analysis also indicates that if recent immigrants in 1970 had faced the 1990 wage structure, their wage distribution would have closely resembled that of recent immigrants in 1990. These and other results suggest that the increasing wage gap is linked to changes in the wage structure.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

As an administrative agency with its mission to produce accurate and credible statistics—free from political manipulation—the Census Bureau is accountable to its hierarchical authority in the Department of Commerce, Congress, the statistical community, and the courts. Conflicts often take place among these accountability dimensions, breeding controversies in census operations, hindering the bureau's efficiency, and threatening the credibility of census statistics.

Despite tentative evidence for a gap in the distribution of flare peak count rates, there is no evidence for X-ray color differences between faint and bright flares. Our preliminary X-ray flare luminosity distribution dN/dL is consistent with a power law with index ; this is similar to some estimates of Sgr A*'s near-IR flux distribution. The observed flares contribute one-third of the total X-ray output of Sgr A* during the campaign, and as much as 10% of the quiescent X-ray emission could be comprised of weak, undetected flares, which may also contribute high-frequency variability.

To overcome this, we modeled the relation of both interviewer-rated skin color and census ethnoracial categories with educational inequality using innovative data from the 2010 America's Barometer from the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) and 2010 surveys from the Project on Ethnicity and Race in Latin America (PERLA) for eight Latin American countries (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru).

For these purposes, projections are often needed for small areas such as census tracts, zip code areas or traffic analysis zones. Population size, growth constraints, shifting boundaries, and data availability create special problems for small-area projections, however, and very little is known about their forecasting performance. In this article we evaluate the accuracy and bias of projections of total population and population by age group for census tracts in three counties in Florida. We use data from 1970 and 1980 and several simple extrapolation techniques to produce projections for 1990; we then compare these projections with 1990 census counts and evaluate the differences. For the total sample, we find mean absolute errors of 17%-20% for the three most accurate techniques for projecting total population and find no indication of overall bias. For individual age groups, mean absolute errors range from 20%-29%.

Over a period of 20 years, 64 species were recorded as nesting in this same area. The difficulties of learning the actual rate of success of nesting birds are discussed, and it is concluded that, in view of the impossibility of assessing the effects of visits of inspection to nests in natural habitats, statements of breeding success are at best rough approximations of what happens in the absence of an observer. In the area of the census, nest‐success (the proportion of nests in which at least one egg was laid that produced at least one living fledgling) was 38–53% in four different years. During the four years 41 % of 208 nests were successful. Of 756 nests of 23 species of altricial birds of the Central American lowlands that build open or roofed nests in clearings and second‐growth, 37% were successful. When the computation is restricted to nests found before the last egg was laid (class B nests), 35% of 434 nests were successful, and 30% of 883 eggs produced living fledglings. In the neighbouring forests, nesting success was much lower, only 23.5% of 136 open or roofed nests producing at least one fledgling. Many forest birds increase their chances of success by entering neighbouring clearings to breed, but few open‐country birds build their nests in the forest. In both forest and clearings, hole‐nesting birds in Central America are much more successful than open‐nesters, as has been found also in the North Temperate Zone. A comparison of the results of a single season's observations in each of six Central American localities shows an increase of nesting success with altitude. In lowland Panama, the nest‐success was only 21%, in the Subtropical Zone of Costa Rica 53%, and in the altitudinal Temperate Zone of Guatemala 55%. The effect of altitude is complicated by differences in the amount of forest in the localities chosen for study, as well as by other factors difficult to assess. In both the tropics and the North Temperate Zone, nest losses are substantially higher in woodland than in man‐made habitats, evidently because there are fewer predators in the latter; but, even in clearings in Central America, nesting success was considerably lower than it was found to be in numerous studies in the North Temperate Zone. The difference may, however, reflect the greater “wildness” of the localities where the writer's studies were made, rather than a true contrast between tropical and temperate zone conditions. Snakes appear to be of the greatest single cause of nest losses in tropical America, but mammals, a few predatory birds, ants, and possibly even bats, destroy many eggs and young. Since small broods and heavy predation permit only a small annual contribution to the adult population, it is evident that, in order to maintain the species, adults must enjoy fairly long lives. Recent statistical studies support this theoretical conclusion.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The magnitude of Type I error for each test was estimated from simulated density—independent data having the same mean and variance as the observed censuses. The actual census data were used to evaluate the ability to detect density dependence. Only autoregression had the desired level of type I error, but this test was ineffective when populations grew or declined. The standard major axis was effective in the latter cases but was ineffective when populations did not grow or decline. The only effective test applicable to all cases was a regression test with a rejection region based oin simulated data. Results of these latter analyses agree with earlier descriptions of interspecific variation in life—history tactics among duck species and the importance of competition as a factor affecting guild structure in prairie—nesting ducks. Diving ducks, which occupy the most temporally stable wetlands, show a greater degree of density dependence than do dabbling ducks, and competition influences the guild structure of diving ducks more than that of dabbling ducks.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Valente,"The Modern Census: Evolution, Examples and Evaluation",census; evolution; examples,2013.0,10.1111/insr.12036,"Summary A national census provides important information on a country's population that is used in government planning and to underpin the national statistical system. Therefore, the quality of such information is paramount but is not as simple as the crude accuracy of population totals. Furthermore, changes in the pace and nature of modern life, such as the growing geographical mobility of the population, increasingly pose challenges to census practice and data quality. More recently, even the need for a census has been questioned on grounds of financial austerity and widespread availability of alternative population information sources. This article reviews how the modern census originated and how it evolved to confront these challenges, driven by indicators of quality and needs of users, and provides reflections on the future of the census within the national statistical infrastructure. To illustrate our discussions, we use case studies from a diverse range of national contexts. We demonstrate the implications that a country's needs, circumstances and experiences have on the census approach and practice while identifying the fundamental demographic assumptions.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

To profile Australian nurse practitioners and their practice in 2009 and compare results with a similar 2007 census. Methods. Self-administered questionnaire. Results. A total of 293 nurse practitioners responded (response rate 76.3%). The majority were female (n = 229, 81.2%); mean age was 47.3 years (s.d. = 8.1). As in 2007, emergency nurse practitioners represented the largest clinical specialty (n = 63, 30.3%). A majority practiced in a metropolitan area (n = 133, 64.3%); a decrease from 2007. Consistent with 2007, only 71.5% (n = 208) were employed as a nurse practitioner and 22.8% (n = 46) were awaiting approval for some or all of their clinical protocols. Demographic data, allocations of tasks, and patterns of practice remained consistent with 2007 results. ‘No Medicare provider number’ (n = 182, 91.0%), ‘no authority to prescribe using the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme’ (n = 182, 89.6%) and ‘lack of organisational support’ (n = 105, 52.2%) were reported as ‘limiting’ or ‘extremely limiting’ to practice. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate less than satisfactory uptake of the nurse practitioner role despite authorisation. Barriers constraining nurse practitioner practice reduced but remained unacceptably high. Adequate professional and political support is necessary to ensure the efficacy and sustainability of this clinical role. What is known about the topic? The nurse practitioner is a developing new model of healthcare delivery that performs an advanced clinical role and is becoming increasingly important in the overburdened Australian healthcare system. Our census conducted in 2007 indicated that nurse practitioners perceived many barriers to their practice and were underutilised in the Australian healthcare workforce, specifically because of their inability to prescribe medications. What does this paper add? This paper provides a second census of Australian nurse practitioners in 2009. Similar to the results in 2007, the study indicates that nurse practitioners remain underutilised, with many unable to perform roles within their defined scope of practice because of limitations, such as inability to prescribe medications, lack of a Medicare provider number and awaiting approval for clinical protocols. Lack of support from within healthcare organisations and the nursing profession also were found. What are the implications for practitioners? Nurse practitioners are not being utilised to their maximum clinical capacity despite increasing pressures on the health system. Many of the barriers to nurse practitioner practice that were flagged in 2007 remained issues in 2009. It is hoped the current legislative reform through the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Act 2010 (Cth) will adequately address these issues.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Unsupervised classification of a monthly time series of net difference vegetation index (NDVI) images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) over January–December 2002 generated 40 classes. Nine generalized classes included five irrigated classes with distinct NDVI time signatures: continuous irrigation, double‐cropped, irrigated with low biomass, minor irrigation, and groundwater irrigation. Areas irrigated by surface water began greening 45 days after groundwater‐irrigated areas, which allowed separation of surface and groundwater irrigation in the classification. The fraction of each class area irrigated was determined using three different methods: ground truth data, a linear regression model calibrated to agricultural census data, and visual interpretation of Landsat TM imagery. Irrigated fractions determined by the three methods varied least for the double‐cropped irrigated class (0.62–0.79) and rangeland (0.00–0.02), and most for the minor irrigated class (0.06–0.43). Small irrigated patches (<0.1 km2) accounted for more irrigated area than all major surface water irrigated areas combined. The irrigated fractions of the minor and groundwater‐irrigated classes differed widely by method, suggesting that mapping patchy and small irrigated areas remains challenging, but comparison of multiple data sources improves confidence in the classification and highlights areas requiring more intensive fieldwork.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The estimates from several different methods of analysis of census data were compared to ""true"" density values based on home range size and overlap for two species. The Whitesides method [Whitesides et al., 1988], which incorporates species-specific mean group spread into its formula for estimating transect width, provided the most accurate density estimates. The importance of including as many groups as possible when calculating density from home range size and overlap is demonstrated with long-term data from Colobus guereza and Cercopithecus mitis. Colobus guereza group density at Isecheno was much lower than that published from a recent brief study [von Hippel, 1996]. Cercopithecus mitis group density has fallen while overall population biomass appears to have remained stable over 20 years of study. Isecheno has the second highest diurnal primate biomass of the ten Guineo-Congolian rainforest sites for which biomass data are available, despite having the lowest primate species richness. Within the Guineo-Congolian rainforest system, primate biomass appears to vary to some extent between ecogeographic regions: two of three mid-elevation East African sites have high biomasses, two of two lowland West African sites have intermediate biomasses, and four of five lowland Central African sites have low biomasses. There is a strong positive correlation between total colobine biomass and total primate biomass at the ten Guineo-Congolian rainforest sites.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Patterns of coverage displayed by the 1990 estimates are described, along with similarities or differences from comparable demographic estimates for previous censuses. The estimated undercount in the 1990 census was 4.7 million, or 1.85%. The undercount of males (2.8%) was higher than for females (.9%), and the undercount of Blacks (5.7%) exceeded the undercount of Non-Blacks (1.3%). Black adult males were estimated to have the highest rate of undercounting of all groups. Race-sex-age patterns of net coverage in the 1990 census were broadly similar to patterns in the 1980 and 1970 censuses.

Fishes associated with the seagrass Posidonia oceanica were censused both by skid trawl and visual counts around Ischia Island, Italy. Both sampling procedures were performed during the day in summer and in winter at two sites. Significant differences in the number of species, number of individuals, biomass, and trophic structure of the fish assemblage were observed between sampling methods. Fewer fish species were recorded by visual counts than by trawling. More individuals and a greater biomass, however, were recorded from visual counts. The population of macrocarnivores (Scorpaenidae, Serranidae) were better estimated by trawling, as were canopy‐dwellers (Syngnathidae; Symphodus rostratus) and benthic species (Gobiidae; Blenniidae; Bothidae). Conversely, good swimmers ( Sparidae; Coris julis, Symphodus spp.), and planktivorous fishes (Centracanthidae, Pomacentridae) mostly escaped the trawl and were better assessed by visual counts. The importance of methodological biases differed from one season to the other and was higher in summer than in winter. Particular attention should be paid to the biases induced by sampling techniques when interpreting data, and different sampling methods should be used to accurately study the fish assemblages of seagrass meadows.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

This procedure depends on the gravitational pull of the LMC, thus allowing us to place a lower bound on the Cloud's mass of $M_{\rm LMC} > 1.24\times10^{11} M_\odot$. This mass estimate is validated by applying the technique to a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with an LMC analogue where we find that while this lower bound may be overestimated, it will improve in the future with smaller observational errors. We apply this technique to dwarf galaxies lacking radial velocities and find that Eri 3 has a broad range of radial velocities for which it has a significant chance ($> 0.4$) of having being bound to the Cloud. We study the non-Magellanic classical satellites and find that Fornax has an appreciable probability of being an LMC satellite if the LMC is sufficiently massive. In addition, we explore how the orbits of the Milky Way satellites change in the presence of the LMC and find a significant change for several objects.

Combined with previous measurements, these new data permit a comprehensive look at how millimeter luminosity (a tracer of disk mass) relates to the separation and mass of a stellar companion. Approximately one third (28-37%) of individual stars in multiples have detectable millimeter emission, a rate half that for single stars (~62%). There is a strong correlation between the luminosity and projected separation (a_p) of a stellar pair. Wide pairs (a_p > 300 AU) have a similar luminosity distribution as single stars, medium pairs (a_p ~ 30-300 AU) are a factor of 5 fainter, and close pairs (a_p < 30 AU) are ~ 5 times fainter yet (aside from a small population of bright circumbinary disks). In most cases, the emission is dominated by a disk around the primary (or a wide tertiary in triples), but there is no clear relationship between luminosity and stellar mass ratio. A direct comparison of resolved disk sizes with predictions from tidal truncation models yields mixed results; some disks are larger than expected given their companion separations. We suggest that the presence of a stellar companion impacts disk properties at a level comparable to the internal evolution mechanisms operating in isolated systems, with both the multiple star formation process itself and star-disk tidal interactions likely playing important roles in the evolution of disk material. From the perspective of the mass content of the disk, we expect that (giant) planet formation is inhibited around the components of close pairs or secondaries, but should be as likely as for single stars around the primaries (or wide tertiaries in hierarchical triples) in more widely-separated multiple star systems.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

For the first time since Independence in 1947 there is clear evidence that the country's intercensal rate of population growth has fallen significantly—from an average annual rate of 2.14 percent between 1981 and 1991 to a rate of 1.93 percent between 1991 and 2001. At the state level there has been little change in the rates of population growth in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, but there are signs of—often quite considerable—reductions in growth rates for most of the remaining states. The provisional census results suggest that there has been a decline in India's population masculinity compared to 1991. But the note contends that this decline is probably largely spurious because females were less fully enumerated in 1991 than they were in 2001. Indeed the sex ratios of the states of Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, and Gujarat have become noticeably more masculine, which may partly reflect the influence of sex‐selective abortion.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

It is, however, not known whether this difference in participation is associated with health status. This study sets out to assess whether a population health survey gives biased estimates of socio-economic inequalities in self-reported health. Methods We compared two independent cross-national data collections, a national health interview survey (n = 10 164) and a census (n = 8 491 528), both carried out in Belgium in 2001 and posing the same health question. We computed the prevalence ratios of poor subjective health among socio-economic groups. To estimate the bias, a relative odds ratio (ROR) was computed as the ratio of the survey prevalence ratio to the census prevalence ratio. Results Less-educated individuals had a lower risk of poor health status in the survey [Prevalence ratio = 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.48–1.86] than in the census (Prevalence ratio = 2.23) leading to an underestimation of the risk associated with low education (ROR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.66–0.83). Compared with better-off groups, those who were not working or who were less educated were generally less likely to participate in the survey when they had a poor health status. Conclusions Overall, the health survey underestimated the effects of low SES on poor health status, due to selection bias. We conclude that strategies to improve participation among disadvantaged socio-economic groups should be identified.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We compare and contrast the patterns from these two new high frequency data products that provide novel insights into the distinct patterns of dynamics for existing small businesses relative to new business formations.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We show that the shortfall is primarily due to underreporting of children in the census. Sex differences in child underreporting were fairly minor. Child underreporting in China is not unprecedented, but child underreporting rates in 2000 were about triple those of previous censuses. We attribute the increase primarily to policy changes beginning in the early 1990s that held officials at all jurisdictional levels personally responsible for enforcing birth quotas.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The new method has resulted in dramatic inconsistencies when comparing low-resolution data to aggregated high-resolution data. Hence, aggregated totals do not match true totals, and the mismatch gets worse as the data resolution gets finer. Here, we address several aspects of this inconsistency with respect to the 2016 usual-residence to place-of-work travel data. We introduce a re-sampling system that rectifies many of the artifacts introduced by the new ABS protocol, ensuring a higher level of consistency across partition sizes. We offer a surrogate high-resolution 2016 commuter dataset that reduces the difference between the aggregated and true commuter totals from ~34% to only ~7%, which is on the order of the discrepancy across partition resolutions in data from earlier years.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The intent was to address two obstacles that confront research in the United States regarding social gradients in women9s health: how women9s social class should be measured, and the absence of socioeconomic data in most health records. STUDY DESIGN--The study was a retrospective cohort analysis, using a community based random sample. Setting--Alameda County, California, 1987. SUBJECTS--51 black and 50 white women, ages 20 to 80 years, identified by random digit dialling, were interviewed by telephone. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Census data were linked to individual records via the respondents9 addresses. Using number of full term pregnancies as an example, multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated that individual class was not significantly associated with this outcome, whereas household class was: women from non-working-class households had 0.8 fewer such pregnancies than women from working class households (95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.4, -0.1). The block group measure functioned most like the household class measure (beta = -0.7, 95% CI = -1.4, 0.1), while the census tract measure was non-significant (beta = -0.4, 95% CI = -1.2, 0.4). Similar results were obtained for the outcomes: age at first full term pregnancy, percent of early terminated pregnancies, and yearly income. CONCLUSIONS--These results suggest block group data may offer a uniform source of social class information that can be appended to individual health records, and that this strategy is not invalidated by concerns regarding ecological fallacy.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We explore the fraction of cool-core (CC) clusters in a large sample of $370$ clusters from IllustrisTNG, examining six common CC definitions. IllustrisTNG produces continuous CC criteria distributions, the extremes of which are classified as CC and non-cool-core (NCC), and the criteria are increasingly correlated for more massive clusters. At $z=0$, the CC fractions for $2$ criteria are in reasonable agreement with the observed fractions but the other $4$ CC fractions are lower than observed. This result is partly driven by systematic differences between the simulated and observed gas fraction profiles. The simulated CC fractions with redshift show tentative agreement with the observed fractions, but linear fits demonstrate that the simulated evolution is steeper than observed. The conversion of CCs to NCCs appears to begin later and act more rapidly in the simulations. Examining the fraction of CCs and NCCs defined as relaxed we find no evidence that CCs are more relaxed, suggesting that mergers are not solely responsible for disrupting CCs. A comparison of the median thermodynamic profiles defined by different CC criteria shows that the extent to which they evolve in the cluster core is dependent on the CC criteria. We conclude that the thermodynamic structure of galaxy clusters in IllustrisTNG shares many similarities with observations, but achieving better agreement most likely requires modifications of the underlying galaxy formation model.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We investigated this issue in an ongoing, large population-based e-cohort. Methods The sample included 122 912 individuals enrolled in the Internet-based, nutrition-focused NutriNet-Santé study between May 2009 and March 2014, with complete baseline data. Participants were recruited via recurrent multimedia campaigns and other traditional and online strategies. Individuals aged 18+ years, residing in France and having Internet access, were eligible for enrolment. Their sociodemographic characteristics were compared with the corresponding 2009 Census data via χ 2 goodness-of-fit tests. The effectiveness of statistical weighting of the e-cohort data was also explored. Results The sample exhibited marked geographical and sociodemographic diversity, including volunteers belonging to typically under-represented subgroups in traditional surveys (unemployed, immigrants, the elderly). Nonetheless, the proportions of women, relatively well-educated individuals and those who are married or cohabiting, were notably larger compared with the corresponding national figures (women: 78.0% vs 52.4%; postsecondary education: 61.5% vs 24.9%; married or cohabiting: 70.8% vs 62.0%, respectively; all p&lt;0.0001).

Here, we profile four human iPSC lines for a total of 450,118 single cells to show how organoid composition and development are comparable to human fetal and adult kidneys. Although cell classes are largely reproducible across time points, protocols, and replicates, we detect variability in cell proportions between different iPSC lines, largely due to off-target cells. To address this, we analyze organoids transplanted under the mouse kidney capsule and find diminished off-target cells. Our work shows how single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can score organoids for reproducibility, faithfulness and quality, that kidney organoids derived from different iPSC lines are comparable surrogates for human kidney, and that transplantation enhances their formation by diminishing off-target cells.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The absence of X-ray emission from the reddest DRGs and BzK galaxies with z-K&gt;3 indicates they must have declining star formation histories to explain their red colors and low SFRs. While the M/L ratio of passively-evolving galaxies may be larger on average, the Spitzer/IRAC data indicate that their inferred stellar masses do not exceed the range spanned by optically selected galaxies, suggesting that the disparity in current SFR may not indicate a fundamental difference between optical and near-IR selected massive galaxies (M* &gt; 10^11 Msun).

In this study, we use the FUSE satellite to search 129 known lya absorption systems at z&lt;0.15 toward 31 AGN for corresponding absorption from higher Lyman lines and the important metal ions OVI. We detect OVI in 40 systems over a smaller range of column density than seen in HI. The co-existence of OVI and HI suggests a multiphase IGM, with warm photoionized and hot ionized components. With improved OVI detection statistics, we find a steep distribution in OVI column density, dN(OVI)/dN_OVI N_OVI^(-2.2+-0.1), suggesting that numerous weak OVI absorbers contain baryonic mass comparable to the rare strong absorbers. The total cosmological mass fraction in this hot gas is at least Omega_WHIM=(0.0022+-0.0003. Gas in the WHIM at 10^5-6 K contributes at least 4.8+-0.9% of the total baryonic mass at z&lt;0.15. We then combine empirical scaling relations for the observed ""multiphase ratio"", N_HI/N_OVI N_HI^(0.9+-0.1), and for hydrogen overdensity in cosmological simulations, N_HI delta_H^{0.7}, with the HI photoionization correction to derive the mean oxygen metallicity, Z_O (0.09 Z_sun)(f_OVI/0.2)^(-1) in the low-z multiphase gas. Given the spread in the empirical relations and in f_OVI, the baryon content in the OVI WHIM could be as large as 10%.

This paper reviews existing evidence, and analyses 2001 Census data for Britain to provide an overview of patterns in the level of migration and the distance migrated, according to the characteristics of migrants and for diverse ethnic groups. Those who migrate in each ethnic group have similar characteristics, leading to the assertion that differences in levels of migration result mainly from differing socio‐economic and age compositions of ethnic groups. This is confirmed through regression analysis. Differences in distance migrated, however, are not explained by the composition of ethnic groups, but may be explained by their primarily urban current areas of residence. Exceptions to the general patterns are highlighted as avenues for further investigation. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

We arrive at a catalog of 1761 objects that are adopted as members of Upper Sco. The distribution of spectral types among the adopted members is similar to those in other nearby star-forming regions, indicating a similar initial mass function. In previous studies, we have compiled mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and the Spitzer Space Telescope for members of Upper Sco and used those data to identify the stars that show evidence of circumstellar disks; we present the same analysis for our new catalog of members. As in earlier work, we find that the fraction of members with disks increases with lower stellar masses, ranging from ≲10% for &gt;1 M ⊙ to ∼22% for 0.01–0.3 M ⊙ . Finally, we have estimated the relative ages of Upper Sco and other young associations using their sequences of low-mass stars in <?CDATA ${M}_{{G}_{\mathrm{RP}}}$?> versus G BP − G RP .

Because of the lack of official epidemiological data in these units, a two phase study was performed with the aim of describing the work profile in Italian RICUs. <h3>METHODS</h3> A national survey of RICUs was conducted from January to March 1997 using a questionnaire which comprised over 30 items regarding location, models of service provision, staff, and equipment. The following criteria were necessary for inclusion of a unit in the survey: (1) a nurse to patient ratio ranging from 1:2.5 to 1:4 per shift; (2) availability of adequate continuous non-invasive monitoring; (3) expertise for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and for intubation in case of NIV failure; (4) physician availability 24 hours a day. Between November 1997 and January 1998 a 3 month prospective cohort study was performed to survey the patient population admitted to the RICUs. <h3>RESULTS</h3> Twenty six RICUs were included in the study: four were located in rehabilitation centres and 22 in general hospitals. In most, the reported nurse to patient ratio ranged from 1:2 to 1:3, with 36% of units reporting a ratio of 1:4 per shift. During the study period 756 consecutive patients of mean (SD) age 68 (12) years were admitted to the 26 RICUs. The highest proportion (47%) were admitted from emergency departments, 19% from other medical wards, 18% were transferred from the ICU, 13% from specialist respiratory wards, and 2% were transferred following surgery. All but 32 had respiratory failure on admission. The reasons for admission to the RICU were: monitoring for expected clinical instability (n=221), mechanical ventilation (n=473), and weaning (n=59); 586 patients needed mechanical ventilation during their stay in the RICU, 425 were treated with non-invasive techniques as a first line of treatment (374 by non-invasive positive pressure, 51 by iron lung), and 161 underwent invasive mechanical ventilation (63 intubated, 98 tracheostomies). All but 48 patients had chronic respiratory disease, mainly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n=451). More than 70% of patients (n=228) had comorbidity, mainly consisting of heart disorders. The median APACHE II score was 18 (range 1–43). The predicted inpatient mortality risk rate according to the APACHE II equation was 22.1% while the actual inpatient mortality rate was 16%. The mean length of stay in the RICU was 12 (11) days. The outcome in most patients (79.2%) admitted to RICUs was favourable. <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3> Italian RICUs are specialised units mainly devoted to the monitoring and treatment of acute on chronic respiratory failure by non-invasive ventilation, but also to weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation. The results of this study provide a useful insight into an increasingly important field of respiratory medicine.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Berman,Quality of 1980 census data for American Indians,quality; census; indians,1986.0,10.1080/19485565.1986.9988637,"Abstract The count of American Indians in the 1980 census was over 70 per cent larger than the 1970 census count. An assessment of the demographic basis for this change shows that the cohorts from ages 10 to 74 in 1980 increased by substantial amounts, reaching 35 per cent for many ages. Increases of this nature in the absence of immigration are demographically impossible—an indication that the changes in response patterns identified by Passel (1976) between the 1970 and 1960 censuses persisted in 1980, possibly at even greater levels. In addition to presenting demographic analyses of the American Indian data at the national level, this paper includes an analysis of geographic variation of implied birth, death, and migration rates at the state level. States which historically have had large American Indian populations in general had high birth and death rates with reasonable migration rates. Many other states, however, had anomalously low birth and death rates with extraordinarily high implied migration rates. This pattern suggests that the changes in response may have occurred primarily in the latter areas. Several other anomalies in the American Indian data are reported here. The sample figure for American Indians from the 1980 census exceeds the complete count by more than 8 per cent at the national level. Increases occurred in most states, but the amount of increase varied substantially. Also, the increases tend to occur outside American Indian areas (reservations, tribal trust lands, etc.). Such differences are, for the most part, outside of expected sample variability. Furthermore, differences in the number of persons reporting American Indian race and American Indian ancestry were substantial. Some of the causes of these differences are investigated here. The paper concludes with an overall assessment of the quality and utility of these census data for various types of analysis.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The secular evolution of the population is simulated following the paths of a statistical sample of stars for different values of the initial kick velocity, drawn from an isotropic Gaussian distribution with mean velocity 0 ≤ ⟨V⟩ ≤ 550 km s-1. The spin-down, induced by dipole losses and by the interaction with the ambient medium, is tracked together with the dynamical evolution in the Galactic potential, allowing for the determination of the fraction of stars which are, at present, in each of the four possible stages: ejector, propeller, accretor, and georotator. Taking from the ROSAT All Sky Survey an upper limit of ~10 accreting neutron stars within ~140 pc from the Sun, we infer a lower bound for the mean kick velocity, ⟨V⟩ ≳ 200-300 km s-1, corresponding to a velocity dispersion σV ≳ 125-190 km s-1. The same conclusion is reached for both a constant magnetic field (B ~ 1012 G) and a magnetic field decaying exponentially with a timescale ~109 yr. Such high velocities are consistent with those derived from radio pulsar observations. Present results, moreover, constrain the fraction of low-velocity stars, which could have escaped pulsar statistics, to less than 1%.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

This paper explores population level patterns of child development across Australian jurisdictions, considering socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Design Census of child development across Australia. Setting and participants Teachers complete a developmental checklist, the Australian Early Development Index (AEDI), for all children in their first year of full-time schooling. Between May and July 2009, the AEDI was collected by 14 628 teachers in primary schools (government and non-government) across Australia, providing information on 261 147 children (approximately 97.5% of the estimated 5-year-old population). Outcome measures Level of developmental vulnerability in Australian children for five developmental domains: physical well-being, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills and communication skills and general knowledge. Results The results show demographic and socioeconomic inequalities in child development as well as within and between jurisdiction inequalities. The magnitude of the overall level of inequality in child development and the impact of covariates varies considerably both between and within jurisdiction by sex. For example, the difference in overall developmental vulnerability between the best-performing and worst-performing jurisdiction is 12.5% for males and 7.1% for females. Levels of absolute social inequality within jurisdictions range from 8.2% for females to 12.7% for males. Conclusions The different mix of universal and targeted services provided within jurisdictions from pregnancy to age 5 may contribute to inequality across the country. These results illustrate the potential utility of a developmental census to shed light on the impact of differences in universal and targeted services to support child development by school entry.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Hannah,Sampling and the Politics of Representation in US Census 2000,politics; representation; us; census,2001.0,10.1068/d289,Counting of people in official censuses and other social surveys produces representations that are arguably of far greater political importance than the representations produced by voting. The recent controversy around the use of sampling methods in US Census 2000 illustrates some important political-geographical dimensions of our decisions regarding whether and how to be counted in surveys. The argument is intended both to illuminate political features of this very important source of geographical data and to encourage a more self-consciously political engagement with the statisitical surveys through which modern citizens more or less consciously contribute to the shaping of our own lives.,group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

More pragmatically, they are molecules which in principle are difficult to synthesize in harsh interstellar environments and, therefore, are a crucial test for astrochemical models. Current models assume that several COMs are synthesized on lukewarm grain surfaces (≳30–40 K) and released in the gas phase at dust temperatures of ≳100 K. However, recent detections of COMs in ≲20 K gas demonstrate that we still need important pieces to complete the puzzle of COMs formation. Here, we present a complete census of the oxygen- and nitrogen-bearing COMs, previously detected in different Interstellar Medium (ISM) regions, toward the solar-type protostar IRAS16293-2422. The census was obtained from the millimeter–submillimeter unbiased spectral survey TIMASSS. Of the 29 COMs searched for, 6 were detected: methyl cyanide, ketene, acetaldehyde, formamide, dimethyl ether, and methyl formate. Multifrequency analysis of the last five COMs provides clear evidence that they are present in the cold (≲30 K) envelope of IRAS16293-2422, with abundances of 0.03–2 × 10−10. Our data do not allow us to support the hypothesis that the COMs abundance increases with increasing dust temperature in the cold envelope, as expected if COMs were predominately formed on lukewarm grain surfaces. Finally, when also considering other ISM sources, we find a strong correlation over five orders of magnitude between methyl formate and dimethyl ether, and methyl formate and formamide abundances, which may point to a link between these two couples of species in cold and warm gas.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The census includes 6.7 million eddies in daily data, which comprise 152,000 eddies tracked over their lifetimes, using a minimum lifetime cutoff of 28 days. Variables of interest include eddy diameter, thickness (vertical extent), minimum and maximum depth, location, rotational direction, lifetime, and translational speed. Distributions of these traits show a predominance of small, thin, short‐lived, and slow eddies. Still, a significant number of eddies possess traits at the opposite extreme; thousands of eddies larger than 200 km in diameter appeared in daily data each year. A tracking algorithm found hundreds of eddies with lifetimes longer than 200 days. A third of the eddies are at least 1000 m tall and many penetrate the full depth of the water column. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current contains the thickest and highest density of eddies. Thick eddies are also common in the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio Current, and Agulhas ring pathway. The great majority of eddies extend all the way to the surface, confirming that eddy censuses from surface observations are a good proxy for the full‐depth ocean.

To address this issue, we surveyed the timing of birth and death of >40 000 leaves of 1445 individuals of 23 evergreen rain forest species in several late primary and early secondary successional plant communities at San Carlos de Rio Negro, Venezuela, in the northern Amazon basin. In all species, the mortality rate generally increased with leaf age. However, in many species, deceleration of death rates with extreme leaf age was noted. In general, for each species, the age structure of leaf populations and the frequency distribution of leaf life span were broad. Species differed substantially in their leaf demography. Measured in their native habitats, seven species common to disturbed open sites had shorter median life spans (0.7 yr) than five species common to open but infertile Bana primary communities (1.9 yr average) or six species common to two tall primary forest communities (Tierra Firme and Caatinga), when measured in high-light conditions in the canopy (2.0 yr average). Variation in light availability had consistent effects on leaf life span in all species. Species native to Tierra Firme forest had average leaf life spans of 3.2, 1.9, and 1.6 yr, respectively, in deeply shaded understory microsites, in small gaps, and in sunlit mature tree canopies. Species native to Caatinga forest had average leaf life spans of 4.2, 3.4, and 2.5 yr, respectively, in these same microsite types. Two species common in gaps and in disturbed sites had much longer leaf life span in shaded understory than in open, disturbed microsites. For all species, responses were similar when trees were planted in sites differing in light availability, as when trees naturally established across light gradients. The rate of leaf production, the risk of leaf mortality, and the leaf life span were not periodic or related consistently to seasonality of climate. Negligible relationships existed between the mild annual dry season and either leaf production or leaf mortality in all species. Thus, leaf phenology and demography were essentially aseasonal in this tropical forest environment.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Opinions vary about the nature and degree of anticipated physician shortages, and health care workforce determinations are fraught with variables and uncertainties that are challenging to address definitively. Identifying accurate information about the nation's currently licensed physician workforce, however, is an important starting point. This article reviews data received in 2014 by the Federation of State Medical Boards from the nation's state medical and osteopathic boards about the current supply of actively licensed physicians in the United States and the District of Columbia. Our census data demonstrates the total population of licensed physicians (916,264) has increased by 4% since 2012, and the nation, on average, added 12,168 more licensed physicians annually than it lost. The average physician is now older (by a year), predominantly male (but increasingly female at entry level) and increasingly a graduate of a medical school in the Caribbean.

On the bacterial chromosome, luxR genes are usually found next or near to a luxI gene encoding the AHL signal synthase. Recently, a number of luxR genes were described that have no luxI genes in their vicinity on the chromosome. These so-called solo luxR genes may either respond to internal AHL signals produced by a non-adjacent luxI in the chromosome, or can respond to exogenous signals. Here we present a survey of solo luxR genes found in complete and draft bacterial genomes in the NCBI databases using HMMs. We found that 2698 of the 3550 luxR genes found are solos, which is an unexpectedly high number even if some of the hits may be false positives. We also found that solo LuxR sequences form distinct clusters that are different from the clusters of LuxR sequences that are part of the known luxR-luxI topological arrangements. We also found a number of cases that we termed twin luxR topologies, in which two adjacent luxR genes were in tandem or divergent orientation. Many of the luxR solo clusters were devoid of the sequence motifs characteristic of AHL binding LuxR proteins so there is room to speculate that the solos may be involved in sensing hitherto unknown signals. It was noted that only some of the LuxR clades are rich in conserved cysteine residues. Molecular modeling suggests that some of the cysteines may be involved in disulfide formation, which makes us speculate that some LuxR proteins, including some of the solos may be involved in redox regulation.",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Principal problem of the IRS data consists in highly volatile income estimates in the low-end of personal income distribution. This volatility is likely related to measurement errors, changes in definitions or improper reporting. Personal income estimates at high and the highest incomes are robust and follow the Pareto law. At high incomes, personal income distributions for 1990 and 2004, when normalized to total population with income and total (gross) personal income, practically coincide. Hence, the inequality estimates based on the IRS data are distorted by inaccurate readings in the low-income zone. At the same time, income data provided by the US Census Bureau are consistent over time in all income ranges. Results presented by Kitov (2007) demonstrate that personal income distributions based on readings obtained in the Current Population Survey are characterized by practically constant Gini coefficient since 1960. This observation implies that normalized personal income distributions are also not changing with time",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

However, screening inequalities continue among racial and ethnic minorities despite having a higher disease burden. In this study, we assessed the patterns of up-to-date colorectal cancer screening rates among racial/ethnic groups across the U.S. Census Bureau Divisions. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study used weighted data from 4 cycles of the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020) of adults aged 50‒75 years without a previous diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The primary outcome was guideline-recommended up-to-date colorectal cancer screening. We used logistic regression models to examine temporal trends in up-to-date colorectal cancer screening from 2014 to 2020. In addition, we conducted detailed descriptive statistics of up-to-date screening rates, comparing trends in 2020 with those in 2014 overall by race/ethnicity and U.S. census divisions. RESULTS: The overall proportion of individuals with up-to-date colorectal cancer screening increased from 66.5% in 2014 to 72.5% in 2020 ( CONCLUSIONS: Although colorectal cancer screening rates improved over time, they fall short of the 80% target.

A critical distinction must be made between the Commission members - political appointees who mostly supported some form of restriction at the time of their appointment - and the top research staff, whose views were remarkably wide ranging. Moreover, even staff members committed to a racialized outlook - such as Daniel Folkmar, author of the Commission's infamous Dictionary of Races and Peoples - deserve a closer look than historians have given them; for example, Folkmar and his superior on the staff had requested commentary from Franz Boas, who was then emerging as the most prestigious academic critic of racial theories (theories that assume group differences in behavior arise from biological endowments). Another feature of the narrative concerns the surprising number of staff who transferred from the Commission to the Census Bureau to work on the 1910 Census.

The Census Bureau constructs a unique data set for each state program by linking the AR data to survey response data for the same individuals. These linked data enable the Census Bureau to model which survey respondents are eligible for program participation and also to observe which eligible individuals participate in the program. The Census Bureau then estimates eligibility and participation rates by a variety of demographic and economic characteristics and by county. The individual-level data also enable the Census Bureau to construct a statistical profile of eligible individuals and families that do not participate to assist state agencies with their outreach programs.

This paper provides empirical evidence about the link between self-participation rates and census accuracy using data from the 1990, 2000, and 2010 U.S Censuses. The preponderance of the evidence shows lower self-participation rates are highly correlated with higher net undercounts and omissions rates for key socio-demographic groups and states. Nine out of 11 correlations examined in this paper are statistically significant and in the predicted direction. One key reason self-participation rates are associated with census accuracy is the fact that the population not captured in the self-participation operation goes into the households for the Nonresponse Followup (NRFU) operation. Census Bureau data show data collected in NRFU is not as accurate as that collected in self-response. The larger the share of data collected for a population that is collected in NFRU, the lower the quality of data for that group. The connection between self-participation rates and census accuracy mean the differential self-participation rates seen in the 2020 Census suggest patterns of net Census undercounts seen in the past are likely to be seen in the 2020 Census",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Despite the growing body of research to understand the scope and characteristics of undercounted young children, little is known about likely causes. Missing from the research are efforts to talk with respondents about possible reasons for young child omissions. This study addresses that shortcoming using data from an online survey asking 800 respondents with young children several questions related to children and the census. The results indicate that many respondents have doubts about including young children in the census count for their household. Only 82 percent of low-income parents of young children responded that they would include their young child in the census count for their household. This percentage was lower if children had weaker ties to a household. These survey results provide evidence that misconceptions and confusion about including young children in the census exist and could easily result in young child omissions. These findings warrant replication and suggest that significant changes in instructions are needed to dispel these respondent misconceptions",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Its defining characteristics are the use of locally recruited, mostly Indigenous collector interviewers, and the administration of a modified collection instrument in discrete Indigenous communities, mostly in remote Australia. The research reported here is unique. The authors, with the assistance of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, were able to follow the workings of the IES in the 2006 Census from the design of the collection instrument to the training of temporary census field staff at the Northern Territory’s Census Management Unit in Darwin, to the enumeration in four remote locations, through to the processing stage at the Data Processing Centre in Melbourne. This allowed the tracking of data from collection to processing, and an assessment of the effects of information flows on the quality of the data, both as input and output. This study of the enumeration involved four very different locations: a group of small outstation communities (Arnhem Land), a large Aboriginal township (Wadeye), an ‘open’ town with a majority Aboriginal population (Fitzroy Crossing), and the minority Aboriginal population of a major regional centre (Alice Springs). A comparison between these contexts reveals differences that reflect the diversity of remote Aboriginal Australia, but also commonalities that exert a powerful influence on the effectiveness of the IES, in particular very high levels of short-term mobility. The selection of sites also allowed a comparison between the enumeration process in the Northern Territory, where a time-extended rolling count was explicitly planned for, and Western Australia, where a modified form of the standard count had been envisaged. The findings suggest that the IES has reached a point in its development where the injection of ever-increasing resources into essentially the same generic set and structure of activities may be producing diminishing returns. There is a need for a new kind of engagement between the Australian Bureau of Statistics and local government and Indigenous community-sector organisations in remote Australia. The agency and local knowledge of Indigenous people could be harnessed more effectively through an ongoing relationship with such organisations, to better address the complex contingencies confronting the census process in remote Indigenous Australia",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

To understand why the drift parameters are more difficult to estimate than the diffusion parameter as observed in many empirical studies, we develop expansions for the bias and variance of parameter estimators for two mostly employed interest rate processes. A parametric bootstrap procedure is proposed to correct bias in parameter estimation of general diffusion processes with a theoretical justification. Simulation studies confirm the theoretical findings and show that the bootstrap proposal can effectively reduce both the bias and the mean square error of parameter estimates for both univariate and multivariate processes. The advantages of using more accurate parameter estimators when calculating various option prices in finance are demonstrated by an empirical study on a Fed fund rate data.;The second part of the dissertation considers a new approach to the dual system estimation for the US Census. Nonparametric estimators for the probability functions of Census enumeration and correct enumeration are proposed, which may be treated as an alternative to the existing post-stratification scheme currently being adapted in the Census undercount estimation. The proposed estimators can handle missing values, categorical covariates and can be used for model diagnostic and checking. An imputation based estimator is shown to have superior theoretical properties than estimators which simply ignore missing values. The proposed approach is employed to analyze data files from the 2000 US Census",group6.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

However, the Validation Project determined that the RDC/TMD Axis I validity was below the target sensitivity of ≥ 0.70 and specificity of ≥ 0.95. Consequently, these empirical results supported the development of revised RDC/TMD Axis I diagnostic algorithms that were subsequently demonstrated to be valid for the most common pain-related TMD and for one temporomandibular joint (TMJ) intra-articular disorder. The original RDC/TMD Axis II instruments were shown to be both reliable and valid. Working from these findings and revisions, two international consensus workshops were convened, from which recommendations were obtained for the finalization of new Axis I diagnostic algorithms and new Axis II instruments.Through a series of workshops and symposia, a panel of clinical and basic science pain experts modified the revised RDC/TMD Axis I algorithms by using comprehensive searches of published TMD diagnostic literature followed by review and consensus via a formal structured process. The panel's recommendations for further revision of the Axis I diagnostic algorithms were assessed for validity by using the Validation Project's data set, and for reliability by using newly collected data from the ongoing TMJ Impact Project-the follow-up study to the Validation Project. New Axis II instruments were identified through a comprehensive search of the literature providing valid instruments that, relative to the RDC/TMD, are shorter in length, are available in the public domain, and currently are being used in medical settings.The newly recommended Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (DC/TMD) Axis I protocol includes both a valid screener for detecting any pain-related TMD as well as valid diagnostic criteria for differentiating the most common pain-related TMD (sensitivity ≥ 0.86, specificity ≥ 0.98) and for one intra-articular disorder (sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.97). Diagnostic criteria for other common intra-articular disorders lack adequate validity for clinical diagnoses but can be used for screening purposes. Inter-examiner reliability for the clinical assessment associated with the validated DC/TMD criteria for pain-related TMD is excellent (kappa ≥ 0.85). Finally, a comprehensive classification system that includes both the common and less common TMD is also presented. The Axis II protocol retains selected original RDC/TMD screening instruments augmented with new instruments to assess jaw function as well as behavioral and additional psychosocial factors. The Axis II protocol is divided into screening and comprehensive self report instrument sets. The screening instruments' 41 questions assess pain intensity, pain-related disability, psychological distress, jaw functional limitations, and parafunctional behaviors, and a pain drawing is used to assess locations of pain. The comprehensive instruments, composed of 81 questions, assess in further detail jaw functional limitations and psychological distress as well as additional constructs of anxiety and presence of comorbid pain conditions.The recommended evidence-based new DC/TMD protocol is appropriate for use in both clinical and research settings. More comprehensive instruments augment short and simple screening instruments for Axis I and Axis II. These validated instruments allow for identification of patients with a range of simple to complex TMD presentations.",group8.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

The PES was a stratified block sample with heavy emphasis placed on hard-to-count population groups. Matching the individuals in the census to the individuals in the PES is an important aspect of census coverage evaluation and consequently a very important process for any census adjustment operations that might be planned. For such an adjustment to be feasible, record-linkage software had to be developed that could perform matches with a high degree of accuracy and that was based on an underlying mathematical theory. A principal purpose of the PES was to provide an opportunity to evaluate the newly implemented record-linkage system and associated methodology. This article discusses the theoretical and practical issues encountered in conducting the matching operation and presents the results of that operation. A review of the theoretical background of the record-linkage problem provides a framework for discussions of the decision procedure, file blocking, and the independence assumption. The estimation of the parameters required by the decision procedure is an important aspect of the methodology, and the techniques presented provide a practical system that is easily implemented. The matching algorithm (discussed in detail) uses the linear sum assignment model to ""pair"" the records. The Tampa, Florida, matching methodology is described in the final sections of the article. Included in the discussion are the results of the matching itself, an independent clerical review of the matches and nonmatches, conclusions, problem areas, and future work required.

With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. Results Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research. Conclusions The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor.",group8.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,

Yet because of differences in national origin, physical appearance, historical memory, class, and religion, no single group identity exists for this rapidly growing population. In part because of this diversity, in the 2000 Census, respondents, for the first time, could select more than one racial category. Clara Rodríguez’s newest work on Latinos in the U.S. examines difficulties in categorizing this group as part of a broader discussion of ethnicity and race in the United States. She chose as her lens the U.S. Census Bureau because census categories and definitions reveal a society’s “dominant ideals and beliefs” (p. xiv) and such definitions shape how peoples and individuals see themselves and others. Rodríguez’s aim is to demonstrate through the Latino experience that race is not fixed; it is “imperfectly measured” and can lead to discrimination and misunderstanding. A sociologist by training, Rodríguez draws upon her own experiences as a Latina, on interviews, analyses of census data, and secondary works from a variety of disciplines.The difficulty in classifying Latinos underscores one of Rodríguez’s main points: definitions of race and ethnicity are subjective and dependent on context. Some public agencies consider Latinos a race, but the Bureau of the Census does not (a topic to which the author devotes ample space). Rodríguez argues that most in the U.S. conflate race and ethnicity, and see race as genetically determined and fixed (as evidenced by Census Bureau efforts to make Latinos and other groups fit the bipolar racial categories of white and non-white). Meanwhile, for Latinos, race and ethnicity are culturally determined, fluid, and contextual. As Rodríguez explains, these divergent notions of race and ethnicity came out of our respective historical experiences.Rodríguez describes the evolution of the U.S.’s bipolar racial paradigm by tracing the Census Bureau’s two-hundred-year history of shifting categories and criteria. She ably links changing racial definitions over time to broader social and political factors, and sees the Bureau’s recent efforts to more accurately categorize Hispanics as evidence that notions of race and ethnicity are undergoing further adjustment in this country.This broad treatment of Latino identity and U.S. efforts to categorize its diverse populations will complement the plethora of new works on the Latino experience in the U.S. It should prove useful also to historians of race and ethnicity in America. While Rodríguez’s arguments are somewhat disorganized and repetitive, the redundancy permits the use of individual chapters for teaching purposes. Further, although little new scholarship appears here, the author provides a relatively thorough review of the literature on issues such as Latino identity formation and acculturation. In addition, Rodríguez’s history of Census activities is also quite thorough, and the book is richly documented. Those seeking more on the historical development of notions of race and ethnicity in Latin America will no doubt be disappointed, however, given the outdated and limited resources consulted. Perhaps the real value of this work is the perspective it offers on how Latinos in this country have been perceived and how they perceive themselves. It is likely that this population group will prove quite instrumental in reshaping our ideas of race and ethnicity.",group8.csv,Unknown,,,Unknown,Published,,,,,
